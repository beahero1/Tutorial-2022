    "This notebook goes through a necessary step of any data science project - data cleaning. Data cleaning is a time consuming and unenjoyable task, yet it's a very important one. Keep in mind, \"garbage in, garbage out\". Feeding dirty data into a model will give us results that are meaningless.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Getting the data - **in this case, we'll be scraping data from a website\n",
    "2. **Cleaning the data - **we will walk through popular text pre-processing techniques\n",
    "3. **Organizing the data - **we will organize the cleaned data into a way that is easy to input into other algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this notebook will be clean, organized data in two standard text formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Corpus** - a collection of text\n",
    "2. **Document-Term Matrix** - word counts in matrix format\n",
    "    - (1) Clean Text - remove excess, unnecessary parts of the text\n",
    "    - (2) Tokenize Text - split the text into smaller pieces\n",
    "    - (3) Document-Term Matrix - Put into a matrix so a machine can read it"

       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you all. Oh, wow. That was exciting, wasn’t it? Thank you, guys. Have a seat, feel comfortable, relax. I want to thank everyone in LA for a wonderful week. It’s been great here. You know what? It’s been ten years since the last time I played Los Angeles, if you can imagine. I know! I know, <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>I’ve been gone for a very long time</strong></span>. And unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years. I’m not gonna take you through all the agony I’ve been through, but it was tough. Some of it you might’ve seen.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don’t know if you ever saw on TMZ the big headline: <strong>“Dave Chappelle Drunk Onstage in Detroit.”</strong> Well, if you saw it, I wasn’t drunk. I had smoked some reefer… with some rappers. Yeah. I don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong, stronger than I what I was accustomed to. The article goes on to say I was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. I was booed. I did not leave. It was a long bomb. It was a fucking nightmare. Two puffs of weed, that’s all it was. Two puffs. I never had that happen, where I take two puffs of weed, I looked at the guy next to me, I was like, “I’m gonna bomb, n i g g a. I can feel it.” And that guy called my name. “Dave Chappelle!” N i g g a s was like… Normally, when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here, but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… That’s how the show started. Didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like, “What the fuck?” They started looking amongst themselves. So I knew I wasn’t doing good. I don’t remember what I was saying. It just took one person to break the ice. It was a black lady with a Ford Motor shirt on. Stood up suddenly. “Fuck you, Dave Chappelle!” I said, “Excuse me?” She said, “I worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!” And in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. “Yeah!” The whole crowd banded together and started chanting, “We want our money back! We want our money back!” I said, “Oh, shit.” I snapped out of it. “Good people of Detroit, hear me. Hear me now. You will never get your fucking money back.” Fuck that. I said, “I’m like Evel Knievel. I get paid for the attempt. I didn’t promise this shit would be good.” “Boo!” They said, “Fuck you!”</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This went on for a long time. And then, after the show, I felt so bad, I took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– I said, “I’m gonna give this to charity.” You know what I did? I bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around Detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. I was very mad at Detroit that night. Because not only did I bomb, I had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again. Fucking nightmare.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That would be like if you were having sex with a woman and, for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason, she had a mousetrap in her pussy. You get caught in the trap. And then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night. I’d still do it, but I’d be careful the next time. The old mousetrap-in-the-pussy trick, eh? Fool me once. Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough time. And I wanted to give up sometimes. I almost did give up, but then, right before I gave up, I decided not to. But I made the call. They answered the phone. “Hello? Dancing with the Stars.” I said, “Not yet. Not yet.” Yeah. If you see me on that shit, it’s over. Trust me. My spirit is broken. If you see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my cha-cha, fuck that.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’ve been hanging out in– I haven’t been working in LA, but I come out here and hang out and shit. I was out here a few weeks ago. <strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I almost got arrested</span></strong>. I’m not bullshitting. This happens to a lot of black people. What happened was… I was coming out of one of those nightclubs in Hollywood, and my friend saw me. I guess I was wobbling or something. So, he just rolled up. He’s a good friend of mine. He’s like, “Hey, Dave, give me the keys.” I was like, “All right, n i g g a, just take the keys.” And I got in the passenger’s side of my car, and he drove it. It was fine. Just talking, chopping it up. And then, on the 10, the blue-and-whites hit us. Now, I should tell you, the friend that was driving me was black, which really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car. Not my fear. I’m black, but I’m also Dave Chappelle. So, I figured, you know, shit will probably be fine. Traffic stop started off on the right foot. The cops came up to the driver’s side. “Hi. How are you guys doing tonight?” And he recognized me immediately. “Oh. Dave Chappelle.” And I looked at my friend like, “We’re getting out of this shit.” And then he says, “You guys were swerving in the lane. Do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second?” Still no cause for alarm. I looked through the rearview mirror. The body language of the arrest looked good. Just talking. So, then I started fucking with the radio. You know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car. But then, when I looked back in the rearview mirror, something had gone horribly wrong. That motherfucker was back there like… And the next thing I knew, they were stuffing him in the back of the car, and I thought what anybody would think in a situation like that: “Oh, my God. What is gonna happen to me?” And the police walked up to the window. “Mr. Chappelle, we had to arrest your friend. He refused to take our breathalyzer test.” I said, “That motherfucker. Not complying? That’s odd. So, officer, what’s gonna happen to me?” “You’re fine. We’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle, and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home.” I said, “Oh, well, no. I would rather you just give me the keys.” He said, “Mr. Chappelle, your friend already told us he’s your designated driver. We can’t let you drive in this condition.” I was like, “No, n i g g a, I’m good.” And then suddenly, the shit turned into Vegas. He was like… “I’ll let you blow for it.” I said, “Excuse me?” He said, “If you blow in my breathalyzer–” I said, “Oh, n i g g a, I thought you was trying to get your dick sucked. What’s the– Whew! Whew!” “If you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, I’ll give you the keys to the car.” I said, “Uh… set ’em up, n i g g a. Let’s play.” And I blew in that thing. And it made a noise. “Beep!” I said, “Uh-oh.” And he looked at it. He said, “Oh, well, Mr. Chappelle, I guess you’re free to go.” I said, “I am?” I didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed. I drove home on the miles an hour. Yeah, it all worked out. It all worked out. I’m one of the lucky ones.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It doesn’t work out that well for everybody. I saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in LA in traffic. You see that shit on rush hour traffic? They beat a black woman’s ass. This woman didn’t even do anything wrong. It’s fucked up. It was so fucked up, it didn’t even go to court. The City of L.A. just gave that woman $1.5 million for her pain and suffering. That is not bad, considering that’s the same amount of money that Marcos Maidana made to fight Floyd Mayweather the second time. And this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life. You can see it on the tape. She didn’t come to fight. Her guards were low. She was taking a lot of shots.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Everybody’s mad at police now. I watched that– You see that shit on Netflix, <em>Making a Murderer</em>? <strong>The Steven Avery story</strong>. If you haven’t seen it, check it out. Steven Avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the United States has ever been in! In a justice system designed for him to thrive, he’s failed miserably twice. I can’t even wrap my mind around it. If <em>Making a Murderer</em> was about a black dude, that shit would be called Duh! Of course everything would go wrong. Seems like he did it, all right. The motherfucker even had $200,000 for his legal defense. That should get you off in Wisconsin. That’s like OJ money. All he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror. That’s all it would’ve took. Because only a black dude in the United States can look at other dudes and be like, “I think the police did this shit.” He’s fucked up in the game. That’s how OJ got off.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’ve been watching that new OJ show. I can’t get enough of that shit. Doesn’t it bring back good memories? But I forgot just how polarizing that OJ case was. And you know, I’ve met OJ Simpson on four different occasions in my life. And before the end of the show, I will tell you about each of those occasions. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>The first time I met OJ Simpson</strong></span>, I was in Santa Monica. -Santa Monica! -Yeah! I can’t believe a black dude was like, “Santa Monica!” You the last n i g g a I would expect to say that. Let me see your shoes. You got some Vans on, n i g g a? What you got? “Santa Monica!” You? At the time, I was . I had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, “Hey, OJ Simpson’s here, and he said he wants to meet you.” I said, “What? Fuck yeah!” I ran down the steps, and OJ was down there. He’s like, “Hey, young man. How are you? It’s very good to meet you. And you’re doing really good work, and I hope good things happen for you in your life.” I was like, “Man, thanks, Mr. Juice.” Standing beside him, was– I don’t know the nice way to say this– his soon-to-be-slain wife. Ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show. Just man the fuck up. She’s dead. We already know what happened. We don’t know who did it, but we know what happened. I should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. She actually embraced me. She said, “I think you’re adorable,” and she hugged me. She goes, “Good luck to you,” and she held me for a long time. And I whispered in her ear, “Bitch, are you trying to get us both killed?” I’m just kidding. I didn’t say that, but… that was the first time, in a nutshell.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities. Very diverse crowd. Looks like you thought Bernie Sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker. But… surprise! It’s me. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I’m happy, really, to see black people come. A lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to. But there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows. One is because, obviously, black people have slower Internet connections. I mean, that would be my guess. I don’t know what– Actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community I hold so dear.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A couple of weeks ago, I was supposed to be in <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Flint, Michigan</strong></span>, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in Flint. I don’t know if you know this, but the water in Flint is fucking poisonous. It’s actually making people sick. Hollywood people are like, “So what? At least they have water.” But this water– this water is fucked up. So, a lot of black celebrities flew into Flint, and they did a tremendous charity benefit, and I was on the schedule to appear.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Uh… So, the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Oscars</strong></span>. Right, I know. So, I was on my way to the airport to go to Flint, and then Chris Rock calls me and is like, “Hey, Dave, I got a ticket for you for the Oscars. Can you make it?” And I was like, “Sure, n i g g a. I’m on my way to the airport right now.” Come on, man. What am I gonna do about that water? What am I, a fucking superhero? I need to have fun. I need to live, too! I didn’t fuck that water up! Stevie Wonder was there. They didn’t need me. I’m sorry, everybody. I’d never been to the Oscars. You’ve seen the movies I make. I was excited.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I knew I was gonna get into some trouble, because when I was walking on the red carpet, the <strong>black press</strong> came after me. “Excuse me, brother.” When you hear somebody call you “brother” too much, something terrible is about to happen. “Excuse me, brother. Brother?” And I looked back, and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie. I said, “Uh-oh.” He said, “I just want to ask you a couple questions.” I said, “What publication are you with?” He said, “Me? I’m with <strong><em>The Daily Bongo</em></strong>.” I said, “<em>Daily Bongo</em>? What the fuck? Who the fuck reads this?” He said, “Listen, brother, I just want to ask you a quick question. You understand that this year, this is a boycott for the Oscars. So, I’m just wondering what made you, of all people, cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight.” I said, “Boycott? N i g g a, I haven’t been working in ten years. What do you mean, boycott? I’ve been on strike. Y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working. I had to watch fucking Key and Peele do my show every night! So, fuck <em>The Daily Bongo</em>,” is what I said. I went to the Oscars and had a wonderful time. I went in that fucking green room. It was filled with so many stars, I couldn’t even believe what I was seeing. Hollywood was seducing me all over again. I was sitting back there. I’m smoking, drinking with the stars.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And then <strong>two Hollywood movie producers</strong> came over, right to me. “Oh, my God. Dave Chappelle,” said the leader one. He was obviously gay. Some guys, you can just tell. The other one seemed like a money guy. Maybe he was from Texas or some shit. But the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking. And then he hit me with: “So, David, um… do you have any <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>movie ideas</strong></span> that you would like to pursue?” The truth is, I don’t. But if you know the game, you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas. I was like, “Yeah, man. I got plenty of ideas.” And he called my bluff. “Really? Like what?” “Huh? Oh. Um… um…”</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And then I just started making up shit that I thought maybe he’d like to see. I said, “I have a superhero idea.” He goes, “Really?” I go, “Yeah. He’s a– He’s a gay superhero.” He was like, “Really?! What’s it called?” “Huh? Oh, it’s called– It’s called <strong>Same Hero, New Boots</strong>. It’s about a gay sous-chef in San Francisco… that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he’s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams, supersonic gay kind of powers. And he starts saving everybody in San Francisco. But at first, he only saves gay people. Later, he saves everybody, and the whole city just falls in love with him. The only problem is, no one remembers him when he saves them.” “Well, I don’t understand. Why wouldn’t they remember him?” I said, “Because, dummy, he’s gay. He keeps changing his outfit. People come up– ‘Thanks for saving me, sir. What’s your name anyway?’ He’s like, ‘Same Hero, New Boots!’ And that motherfucker flies away.”</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He was like, “I like it a lot.” The Texan didn’t like that shit at all. He was upset. “That’s impossible, a gay superhero.” I said, “What? Well, I have others. <strong>I have a superhero you’d love</strong>, ’cause he’s stronger than Superman and he fights for truth, justice and the American way, like Superman, but more than Superman. He beats up Mexicans for no reason.” The Texan’s like, “You got my attention.” I’m like, “Man, this motherfucker’s so strong, he can fly and do all this great shit. Only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina. Not a long touch, just a couple of pats.” He said, “Well, what’s the problem with that?” I said, “The problem, sir, is that our hero is not a handsome man. And he’s often short on cash. So, whenever trouble breaks out, he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas. ‘Please, miss! That building’s on fire. Can I pat your vagina? Quickly. People are dying!’ But he can’t tell them exactly why. ‘Eww! Get away! You’re gross!’ ‘Please, miss! People are dying! Just a couple of pats!’ ‘Eww! Gross! Get away!’ So, he rapes them.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know, I know. That’s the dilemma for the audience. Because he rapes, but he saves a lot of lives. And he saves way more than he rapes, and he only rapes to save. But he does rape.” I didn’t realize it, but the whole green room was looking at us. All the celebrities were disgusted. “Ohh.” That guy from Texas was like, “Here’s my card. Call me on Monday.” That worked out.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>The second time I met OJ Simpson</strong></span>. It was right after the trial of the century. There I was, now a young man of probably 23. OJ Simpson was the most famous, or infamous, face on planet Earth. I was in a restaurant in Beverly Hills with my agents. I wasn’t alone in the restaurant, but I was alone. I was the only black person in the restaurant. And in the 90’s, that felt very uncomfortable. Now I tend to enjoy it at this age. I was having dinner with my agents, celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative, but I later learned fucking sucked. And suddenly, a group of women walked by. Every race was in that group. Black, white, Asian, Latina, white, white… and white again. They were all gorgeous. I watched them walk by. Then I saw a familiar face. Al Cowlings, the man from the infamous Bronco chase, walked by and embraced one of the women, and they walked towards the door. Couldn’t believe what I saw. And then, close behind him, was OJ Simpson, newly released from jail. The restaurant fell still. I was shocked. I didn’t mean to say it out loud, but it just came out. “OJ!” He stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. I was sitting in the corner of the booth. He leaned over all the white people I was having dinner with and shook my hand. “How are you, young man?” He looked in my eyes, and I could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time. And then he walked away. And I looked back at my agents, and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. And the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named Sharon who used to represent me. “How could you?” she said. “How could you shake hands with that murderer?” I said, “Sharon, with all due respect, that murderer ran for over 11,000 yards. And he was acquitted. So, you know, fuck it. The glove didn’t fit. The glove didn’t fit. Get over yourself.” Some people can’t do that.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some people just can’t get over themselves. Gay people have a hard time doing that recently. Here we go. Here comes the deep water. No, recently I’ve noticed that. I noticed it with that <strong>Manny Pacquiao controversy</strong>. Yeah, it was– Now, in the gay community’s defense, Manny Pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people, very not nice things that I won’t repeat, but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals. It wasn’t a good look. Nike took his shoes immediately. Which I thought was a little harsh. A little harsh, you know what I mean? Just ’cause he’s Asian. You know what I mean? How the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an Asian dude to appease a gay dude? You know what I mean? No? You don’t know what I mean. But Asian people kind of know what I mean. No? No Asians in the front? No? No, this is what I mean. Look, you’re an Asian dude– I say this with no disrespect.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We’re all Americans, right? And we can agree that America has a huge body count all over the world, but nowhere more than Asia. Literally, if you look at history, recently, we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent. We dropped two atomic bombs on fucking Japan, and they’ve been drawing Hello Kitty and shit ever since. There’s a lot of lady-boys in the wake of our bombs. And I know these things because my wife is Asian. She’s Filipino. All right, okay. So, that explains it. Now you know why you see me at all those Filipino events. I’m not there picking up pussy. I’m dropping some off. I take my wife to all that shit. I took my wife to see Pacquiao fight Mayweather. We sat ringside, okay? That– Yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, that’s what that was.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But if you know what’s popping in the Philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the Philippines growing up without their mothers. Yes. A lot of women in the Philippines go to the Arabian Peninsula, they come to the United States, they make all their money here, they send all that money back home, which is still one of the number-one staples in the Philippines’ economy– money that the expats send back to the Philippines. The men, on the other hand, are left rearing children, twiddling their thumbs, waiting on their wives’ checks. These men have been fucking emasculated.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And then suddenly, a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist. This is not the guy you’re supposed to ask, “What do you think of homosexuals?” He’s not your champ. Shit. That’s why I don’t have a sneaker deal, ’cause if you say something that people don’t like, they’ll take your fucking shoes off.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If Martin Luther King had a sneaker deal, we’d still be on the back of the bus. It’s true. The Nike exec would come up– “Hi, Martin. Uh… we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans. It’s upsetting our Southern distributors.” “But I don’t understand. I thought that’s why I had a sneaker deal in the first place.” “Not quite. Really, it’s a walking shoe. And we like the marching, but… Try to understand.” Fuck that shit.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You know, I get it, though. I understand why gay people are mad, and I empathize. You know what? I’m just telling you this as a black dude. I support your movement. But if you want to take some advice from a Negro, pace yourself. These things take a while. Just ’cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it. Brown v. Board of Education was in<i>.</i></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\">\n",

       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Somebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last Wednesday. It takes a minute. <strong>My wife’s friend Stewart</strong> told me that. My wife has a lot of gay friends. Stewart’s their leader. She has a lot of gay friends. And I don’t like ’em. Not ’cause they’re gay. I’m just judging them on the merits of their character. They’re just not nice dudes. They’re fucking rude houseguests. They’re sitting on my couch, giggling with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons. Then I come in, and they act like the party’s over. “Hey, Stewart. What’s going on?” This guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk. “Hi, David.” “Stewart, what’s all the beef, man? What’s going–” He always wants to have some kind of gay political argument. The last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words “husband and wife” out of the law. I said, “Why would you want those words out of the law?” He said, “Because it discriminates against same-sex couples.” I was like, “N i g g a s, please, save me the semantics. Just trust me. Take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino. You’re about to crap out! Just go outside, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, that’s the wife.” No, no. Stewart didn’t like that. Stewart educates me about this movement. I didn’t even know shit about it. He told me it’s called “LBGTQ!” I was like, “What the fuck is the ‘Q’?” Does that even make sense? “Q”? Turns out “Q” is like the vowels. That shit is sometimes “Y.” It’s for gay dudes that don’t really know they’re gay. Like prison fags who are like, “What? I’m not gay, n i g g a. I’m just sucking these dicks to pass the time. I’m not ‘G.’ I’m ‘Q.’ Ugh.” I think– Okay, again, of all those letters, the “T” has the toughest road ahead. In fact, I think the “T” should stand for “Tough road ahead.”</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They’ve got the longest mental gap to bridge. That’s all I’m saying. Because whenever I see one of them Ts on the street, I don’t mind them, but I’ll be like, <strong>“Man, I miss Bruce.”</strong> I’m sorry, guys. I’m 42. I remember Bruce Jenner. Before the Kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white American superhero. It was amazing. He was beating Africans at track and field. We’d never seen anything like it. He was on my cereal box growing up. You know how much of that cereal I ate? N i g g a, I didn’t know he was gonna do that. I knew before you guys knew. I heard things on the street in Hollywood. You’d just be out, see people. “Hey, what’s up, Kanye? Why the long face?” “N i g g a, you’ll see. I got two mother-in-laws now.” And when I heard he was gonna do it, I was scared. I didn’t think the public was ready. I didn’t think the media was ready. And you know what? I was wrong. Not only did the public embrace him, but the media was nice. I’d never seen anything like it. “Welcome to the world, Caitlyn. So long, Bruce. Hello, Caitlyn.” I was shocked! Is this happening?</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wait a minute. Is this a time in American history where an American can make a decision for themselves, and even though other Americans don’t understand it, they’ll support it and let this person live a happy life? Is this what’s happening? If it is, then good for America. That’s Dave Chappelle, the American. Although, Dave Chappelle, the black American, he was a little jealous. I was like, <strong>“How the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination Olympics?”</strong> If the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year, there’d be a fucking war in LA. I know black dudes in Brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe. Transgenders are gangsters. I used to do business with a transgender in Hollywood. Man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom. She’d walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse. Wouldn’t say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit. Then she’d walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table. “Let’s talk business, gentlemen.” “Aaah!” Shit is scary as fuck. If your best friend pitched that to you, you’d be horrified. “Yo, n i g g a, let’s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits.” “What?! Can’t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something? You sure that’s what you want to do?” “There’s only way to find out, n i g g a. Wu-Tang! Pow! Pow! Let’s go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us. Yeah.”</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>The third time I met OJ Simpson</strong></span>— The third time I met OJ Simpson, I was doing great in life. I’d just finished the second season of <i>Chappelle’s Show.</i> Man, those were good days. I was playing a comedy club in Miami, The Improv. I don’t know if you’ve ever been, but if you have, you’d know the door for the green room is right on the stage. Can you imagine such a thing? If I walked out of the door of the green room, bam, I was right here, right from the dressing room. And I did that. I walked out, and the whole crowd was like, “Hooray!” And I looked– ma’am, as close as you are to me– I saw him as soon as I came out: The Juice. And I saw recognition in his eyes, and it filled me with pride that he knew who I was. I didn’t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience, and I didn’t want to start a panic. But I did my show. The show went great. I said, “Good night, everyone.” They all said, “Yay!” And I didn’t say nothing to OJ, but I just gave him the signal to let him know I knew he was there. And I walked into the green room, and OJ was already in there! I was like, “How the fuck is this possible?” I was scared. And then my friends came in, and we all started talking. We sat down on the couch. And I’m just telling you what I saw with my own eyes. You can believe me or not believe me. But in my experience, OJ Simpson– one of the nicest men I’d ever met. He was nice to me. He was nice to my friends. The conversation was filled with warmth and levity, humor and wisdom. We talked for minutes, and then suddenly, the Juice said, “You know what? I’ve got to be going. But it’s good to see you again, and I’m glad things went so well.” I said, “Thanks, Juice.” And my friends said, “Yeah, goodbye, Mr. Juice.” They were new to the game. He said, “No. Thank you… for your hospitality. Good night, guys.<i>“</i> And we said, “Good night.” And he just walked out of the room. And as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like, “That n i g g a did that shit. Did you feel that? I could feel like… murder in the room.”</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Well, you young heads missed that shit. <strong>You’re all too young</strong>. You don’t remember that. -How old are you, young, man? You. -Twenty-four. Twenty-four? You don’t know shit. You don’t know shit! You gotta Google shit that I lived through. See, this is why I lock motherfuckers’ phones up. Seriously. Because the young kids, you guys need to take a break from that– We all need to break just from that technology, just for a minute. You know, I’m from a different time, young man. A dark time to you. I’m from a time that I didn’t even used to know who was on the phone until I answered the shit. Like, when tragedy used to strike.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I remember I was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom. You remember these days? And she turned it on to one of three channels. And she said, “Class, <strong>the space shuttle</strong> is taking off, and we’re all gonna watch it take off.” Man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes. That’s right. You remember. It fucking exploded! Right on television. Everybody on board, dead. Immediately presumed dead. It was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like… “You can go home.” It was a goddamn national tragedy. This was Cold War America. The Russians were laughing at us.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My point is, for a guy your age wouldn’t even know the pain, because in your generation, it’s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day. How can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing? I’m getting over one cop shooting, and then another one happens, and then another one happens, and another one happens. I’m crying about Paris, and then Brussels happens. I can’t keep track of all this shit. So you just give the fuck up. That’s the hallmark of your generation, and that’s fucked up, because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history. <strong>This is the age of spin</strong>. The age where nobody knows what the fuck they’re even looking at. Did you know that Planned Parenthood was for abortions? It’s for people that don’t plan things out at all. That’s right. So, a guy your age doesn’t really know how he feels. Are you pro-choice? Are you anti-consequences? What does it all really mean? It’s easier not to care for you. But for us, we were trained to care. We were raised that way.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I used to watch a fucking cartoon when I was growing up called <i><strong>Care Bears</strong>.</i> It was about a fucking group of teddy-bear people. They were like teddy bears, but they were like people, and they were all different colors, and they all fucking just walked around, caring. They cared about each other and everything else. They all had different designs on their stomachs, and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside. Very, very loving group of beings. And when shit got real bad, as nice as those teddy bears were, they didn’t get mean faces. They got determined. Hmm! And the leader would say, “Come on, guys. It’s time for the Care Bear Stare!” Remember that shit? And them little teddy bears would lock arms… and stare at the problem– and I’m not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests… and would dispel anything that was fucked up. And when we grew up, we wanted to be like those bears. And then we got our hearts broken, because we found out that life wasn’t gonna let us do that and that it’s impossible to shoot love out of your chest.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, I have shot love onto somebody’s chest before. I do it all the time. It’s the next best thing. You kids don’t know. Your generation is just determined to be angry, mad. Everybody’s mad. Back when we were growing up, only black people were mad. Now everybody’s just trying to get in on the act. I try to think to myself, <strong>“When did everyone get mad?”</strong> And then I realize this happened before we were born. This is a long way to go, but… it probably started in the Second World War. Think about it. All these black men, millions of black men, leave the United States for the first time, go over to Europe with America’s Armed Forces and fight the Nazis and make more money fighting Nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the United States. And a lot of those men, while they were in Europe– just to be real, not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women. I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen. This was <strong>World War II Europe</strong>, and these were desperate times, and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things. And it’s very hard to come back to America and sit on the back of the bus after you’ve been in the South of France, getting your dick sucked for a Crunch bar or some crazy shit like that. That’s a life-changing experience. And while that was happening in Europe, here in America, for the first time, <strong>women</strong> entered the workforce en masse, by the millions. All the men were gone. Someone had to run the factory. The ladies did it. That’s right. This was the first generation of American women to have independent income en masse, and when the men came back, the women weren’t the same. American women had grown. They were uttering phrases that no woman on Earth had ever spoken before, things like, “No” and “Shut the fuck up” and “I don’t feel like it.”</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agency that started <strong>testing mind control drugs</strong> on the American public. They fucked up. They tested it for 12 years. They didn’t realize these drugs were not mind-controlling. They were mind-expanding. It was LSD and mescaline and shit like that. And for the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in. By 1960, the <strong>President of the United States</strong> was only 42 years old. Can you imagine? DMX is older than that. And he was gonna usher in a new era of peace. He was gonna avoid the Cold War. He was gonna end segregation. And they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in Dallas. This country was never the same. There were seven more major <strong>assassinations in the ’60s</strong>. Anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog. Kennedy, Kennedy, King, X, Evers, on and on. You didn’t even have to be famous. You could be a college student at Kent State, or in Mississippi, protesting the Vietnam War, and they shot them, too.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The ’70s</strong> were a wild era. And while all this was going on… <strong>Bill Cosby raped 54 people</strong>. Holy shit. That’s a lot of rapes, man. This guy’s putting up real numbers. He’s like the Steph Curry of rape. Man, that’s a lot of rapes. Fifty-four? If he had raped less people… that’s still two dozen rapes! Don’t forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s over hours of rape. It only takes hours to get a pilot’s license. If rapes were aircrafts, this n i g g a is Top Gun for sure.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yeah, that’s a tough one. And I was onstage not too long ago. I was in <strong>Syracuse, New York</strong>. Yeah. Well, yeah, for Syracuse. But the show didn’t go so good… all because I was talking about Bill Cosby a little bit. Not a little bit. I’ll be honest. I talked about him for like, minutes. And a woman stood up in the back of the room, and she screamed out, “You are a fucking asshole for saying these things!” “I know.” Instantly, I felt bad. Not bad about what I was saying. I just felt bad like, “Oh, that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show.” I didn’t realize it at first, but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. By the time I saw her, I just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. I was horrified. I said, “Oh, my God! I’m gonna kick this bitch in the face.” Lucky for me, I didn’t have to. Security tackled her. But it was a really fucking horrifying scene. A scuffle ensued. And then, finally, she screamed out to me, <strong>“Women suffer!”</strong> I said, “I know.” And, ladies, I need you to know… that I know. I need you to know. Seriously, there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. I would include myself in that. Don’t ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. There’s a lot of men like that in this room. There’s a lot of men like that in the world. Or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass n i g g a s. But as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, I started to take offense. And I’ll be honest, race was involved. She was a young white woman. Well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through. “Bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?” She didn’t get it. She just kept going. “Women suffer!” “I know.” “Women suffer!” “Same team.” “Women suffer!” “I know.” And this is when she went too far: “We suffer just like you.” “Slow your roll, bitch. You suffer, yes, but not like me. Not like us.” She goes, “Suffering is suffering. What’s the difference?” I said, “Come on, white woman, you know what it is. You was in on the heist. You just don’t like your cut.” You suffer, I suffer. You suffer, I suffer. That’s how it works.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Can’t do <strong>comparative suffering</strong>. If you’re hungry, and your friend says, “You know, people are starving in Africa,” “So what, n i g g a? I still want lunch.” Black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that it’s a fucking dead-end game. Blacks and Jews do that shit to each other all the time. You ever played Who Suffered More with a Jewish person? It’s a tough game. Whenever you think you’ve got the Jewish guy on the ropes, that motherfucker will be like, “Well, don’t forget about Egypt.” “Egypt?! God damn, n i g g a, I didn’t know we was going all the way back to Egypt.” What the fuck is wrong with her? What does she think? Does she think that I don’t know that rape is wrong? Does she think that maybe I don’t have empathy for Bill Cosby’s alleged victims? And I would be remiss if I didn’t remind you that technically these are all still allegations. Although, I admit it looks very bad. Perhaps if she looked at it correctly, she would have empathy for me, the man she was attacking, a 42-year-old black comedian.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Obviously, Bill Cosby was a hero to me. And she doesn’t know what it feels like to think that your hero might’ve done something so heinous, my God, you can’t imagine. It’d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself… had raped 54 people. You’d say to yourself, “Oh, man, but I like chocolate ice cream. I don’t want it to rape.” Didn’t want to believe it. At first, I didn’t believe it. I said, “These people are obviously trying to destroy Dr. Cosby’s rich legacy.” Even 34 allegations into it, I was still like, “Man… he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people.” I know, I know. But it’s really tough.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You guys are young. Imagine if you found out 40 years from now that <strong>Kevin Hart</strong> raped 54 people. You’d be like, “Oh, my God.” The only one that would believe that would be Katt Williams. He’d be like, “I knew that motherfucker was up to something! I knew Kevin had raped those people.” You know, I was mad at Kevin, too, though. You know why? Okay, first of all, I didn’t even know Kevin was as successful as he was. I found that shit out the hard way. I was at home when my son busted in. He said, “Dad, I need $250.” He’s only years old, so I freaked out. “What’s going on, n i g g a? Is somebody trying to kill you?” He said, “No, no. Kevin Hart’s coming to town, and I wanted to see his show.” I said, “How much are the tickets?” He said, “They’re $125.” I said, “God damn! Mine are only 80.” I said, “Why do you need $250, then?” He goes, “Because I want to go with you, Dad. Please? And there it is. So, I took him to the show. And we go, we sit right up front. The lights go down, and one opening act after another goes on. Then Kevin takes the stage. The crowd goes fucking nuts. Thousands of people. I was furious. The longer the show went on, the madder I got. Because his show was fucking outstanding. It was maddening. These people were fucking holding their stomachs. My son was slapping his knee. I’m like, “Damn, n i g g a, I do this, too.” Kevin says, “Good night.” The crowd goes crazy. And then everyone starts walking to his door, and the lights come on, and then my son is just standing there, looking at an empty stage. People are pushing past me, and nobody’s recognizing me. I’m like, “Man, this place fucking sucks!” I said, “Come on, son, let’s get out of here.” Then my son looks back at me and says, “Dad, please. Please, I have to meet him.” I was like, “Oh, my God.” So, I took him backstage. I’ve known Kevin for years, but can you believe I was scared to knock on his dressing room door? I almost said… “Son, I haven’t seen him for a long time.” And one of Kevin’s goons opened the door. “Hey, what’s up, Dave Chappelle? What are you doing, man? It’s good to see you, brother. What are you doing in this area? This is a terrible area.” I’m like, “Actually, I live around here. Listen… is Kevin here? My son just wanted to meet him real quick.” “I don’t know, ’cause Kevin’s about to eat dinner.” Just then, Kevin came around the corner to see who it was. “What? Oh, shit! What’s up, Dave? Come on back. I was just about to have dinner. I don’t know if you guys ate, but you’re welcome to join me if you’d like.” And then my son pushed passed me. It was some cold shit. He goes, “Actually, Mr. Hart, we haven’t eaten in several hours.” Man, Kevin took us into his back room. This guy had a fucking spread. It was Tuesday night. This motherfucker was having Sunday dinner. There were steaks, chops, corn with butter all over it. My son was eating all fast, embarrassing me. I was like, “Slow down, son.” He was like… Then I looked over in the corner, and there was a box of custom-made jerseys for the local team. Each one was hand-stitched, and on the back, they stitched on “K-Hart” on all of them. Kevin saw me staring at that box, and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys, and he walked right to my son. He said, “Hey, little man. I want you to have this.” And my son was like, “Thanks, Mr. Hart.” This is when I got mad. He goes, “If your father ever makes you mad, put that on.” And he walked out. Oh, that was some cold shit. Then I realized– I looked up what Kevin made on Google. I couldn’t believe that shit. Kevin is the first comedian that a Drake song could be about. Kevin could walk around his house and sing “All Me,” and the whole song would still be true.</p>\n",

       "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let’s not forget. Let’s not forget. I’ve never met Bill Cosby, so I’m not defending him. Let’s just remember that he has a <strong>valuable legacy</strong> that I can’t just throw away. I remember that he’s the first black man to ever win an Emmy in television. I also remember that he’s the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately. I remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the Super Bowl every Thursday night. And I remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of African-Americans on his show. I’m telling you, that’s no small thing. I’ve had a television show. I wouldn’t have done that shit. He gave tens of millions of dollars to African-American institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college. Not just the ones he raped. Here comes the kicker. You ready? Here’s the fact that I heard, but haven’t confirmed. I heard that when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a PA system that Bill Cosby paid for. So, you understand what I’m saying? The point is this: He rapes, but he saves. And he saves more than he rapes. But he probably does rape. Thank you very much! Good night!</p>\n",

The fourth time is not the funniest time, but it was the last time I’d see the Juice. For some reason, I was at the Kentucky Derby. It’s a very long story. <i>This is right after I quit Chappelle’s Show</i> in spectacular fashion. There was a party hosted by Michael Jordan, and every athlete I’ve ever admired was in that room. Yes. And then I saw a familiar face by the bar, standing there, drinking alone. It was Chris Tucker. Now… you have to remember, at this time, we were both technically missing. And we went over, and we’re talking with one another, and motherfuckers were amazed to see us together. Seeing me and Chris Tucker at that point would be like seeing Bigfoot riding a unicorn. You wouldn’t believe that’s what you were seeing. And then, through all the gawkers, a familiar face pushed through the crowd. Here he was again. The Juice. He had his camera ready. He was like, “Dave, Chris. Good to see you guys. Hey, come on, guys. Let’s all get together for a picture.” And at the same time, me and Chris were like, “No. I can’t do that. Sorry, Juice, my career is too flimsy to survive a picture with you.” That’s the end. Good night.</p>\n",

       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you all. Oh, wow. That was exciting, wasn’t it? Thank you, guys. Have a seat, feel comfortable, relax. I want to thank everyone in LA for a wonderful week. It’s been great here. You know what? It’s been ten years since the last time I played Los Angeles, if you can imagine. I know! I know, <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>I’ve been gone for a very long time</strong></span>. And unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years. I’m not gonna take you through all the agony I’ve been through, but it was tough. Some of it you might’ve seen.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don’t know if you ever saw on TMZ the big headline: <strong>“Dave Chappelle Drunk Onstage in Detroit.”</strong> Well, if you saw it, I wasn’t drunk. I had smoked some reefer… with some rappers. Yeah. I don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong, stronger than I what I was accustomed to. The article goes on to say I was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. I was booed. I did not leave. It was a long bomb. It was a fucking nightmare. Two puffs of weed, that’s all it was. Two puffs. I never had that happen, where I take two puffs of weed, I looked at the guy next to me, I was like, “I’m gonna bomb, n i g g a. I can feel it.” And that guy called my name. “Dave Chappelle!” N i g g a s was like… Normally, when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here, but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… That’s how the show started. Didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like, “What the fuck?” They started looking amongst themselves. So I knew I wasn’t doing good. I don’t remember what I was saying. It just took one person to break the ice. It was a black lady with a Ford Motor shirt on. Stood up suddenly. “Fuck you, Dave Chappelle!” I said, “Excuse me?” She said, “I worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!” And in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. “Yeah!” The whole crowd banded together and started chanting, “We want our money back! We want our money back!” I said, “Oh, shit.” I snapped out of it. “Good people of Detroit, hear me. Hear me now. You will never get your fucking money back.” Fuck that. I said, “I’m like Evel Knievel. I get paid for the attempt. I didn’t promise this shit would be good.” “Boo!” They said, “Fuck you!”</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This went on for a long time. And then, after the show, I felt so bad, I took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– I said, “I’m gonna give this to charity.” You know what I did? I bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around Detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. I was very mad at Detroit that night. Because not only did I bomb, I had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again. Fucking nightmare.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That would be like if you were having sex with a woman and, for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason, she had a mousetrap in her pussy. You get caught in the trap. And then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night. I’d still do it, but I’d be careful the next time. The old mousetrap-in-the-pussy trick, eh? Fool me once. Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough time. And I wanted to give up sometimes. I almost did give up, but then, right before I gave up, I decided not to. But I made the call. They answered the phone. “Hello? Dancing with the Stars.” I said, “Not yet. Not yet.” Yeah. If you see me on that shit, it’s over. Trust me. My spirit is broken. If you see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my cha-cha, fuck that.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’ve been hanging out in– I haven’t been working in LA, but I come out here and hang out and shit. I was out here a few weeks ago. <strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I almost got arrested</span></strong>. I’m not bullshitting. This happens to a lot of black people. What happened was… I was coming out of one of those nightclubs in Hollywood, and my friend saw me. I guess I was wobbling or something. So, he just rolled up. He’s a good friend of mine. He’s like, “Hey, Dave, give me the keys.” I was like, “All right, n i g g a, just take the keys.” And I got in the passenger’s side of my car, and he drove it. It was fine. Just talking, chopping it up. And then, on the 10, the blue-and-whites hit us. Now, I should tell you, the friend that was driving me was black, which really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car. Not my fear. I’m black, but I’m also Dave Chappelle. So, I figured, you know, shit will probably be fine. Traffic stop started off on the right foot. The cops came up to the driver’s side. “Hi. How are you guys doing tonight?” And he recognized me immediately. “Oh. Dave Chappelle.” And I looked at my friend like, “We’re getting out of this shit.” And then he says, “You guys were swerving in the lane. Do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second?” Still no cause for alarm. I looked through the rearview mirror. The body language of the arrest looked good. Just talking. So, then I started fucking with the radio. You know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car. But then, when I looked back in the rearview mirror, something had gone horribly wrong. That motherfucker was back there like… And the next thing I knew, they were stuffing him in the back of the car, and I thought what anybody would think in a situation like that: “Oh, my God. What is gonna happen to me?” And the police walked up to the window. “Mr. Chappelle, we had to arrest your friend. He refused to take our breathalyzer test.” I said, “That motherfucker. Not complying? That’s odd. So, officer, what’s gonna happen to me?” “You’re fine. We’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle, and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home.” I said, “Oh, well, no. I would rather you just give me the keys.” He said, “Mr. Chappelle, your friend already told us he’s your designated driver. We can’t let you drive in this condition.” I was like, “No, n i g g a, I’m good.” And then suddenly, the shit turned into Vegas. He was like… “I’ll let you blow for it.” I said, “Excuse me?” He said, “If you blow in my breathalyzer–” I said, “Oh, n i g g a, I thought you was trying to get your dick sucked. What’s the– Whew! Whew!” “If you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, I’ll give you the keys to the car.” I said, “Uh… set ’em up, n i g g a. Let’s play.” And I blew in that thing. And it made a noise. “Beep!” I said, “Uh-oh.” And he looked at it. He said, “Oh, well, Mr. Chappelle, I guess you’re free to go.” I said, “I am?” I didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed. I drove home on the miles an hour. Yeah, it all worked out. It all worked out. I’m one of the lucky ones.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It doesn’t work out that well for everybody. I saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in LA in traffic. You see that shit on rush hour traffic? They beat a black woman’s ass. This woman didn’t even do anything wrong. It’s fucked up. It was so fucked up, it didn’t even go to court. The City of L.A. just gave that woman $1.5 million for her pain and suffering. That is not bad, considering that’s the same amount of money that Marcos Maidana made to fight Floyd Mayweather the second time. And this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life. You can see it on the tape. She didn’t come to fight. Her guards were low. She was taking a lot of shots.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Everybody’s mad at police now. I watched that– You see that shit on Netflix, <em>Making a Murderer</em>? <strong>The Steven Avery story</strong>. If you haven’t seen it, check it out. Steven Avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the United States has ever been in! In a justice system designed for him to thrive, he’s failed miserably twice. I can’t even wrap my mind around it. If <em>Making a Murderer</em> was about a black dude, that shit would be called Duh! Of course everything would go wrong. Seems like he did it, all right. The motherfucker even had $200,000 for his legal defense. That should get you off in Wisconsin. That’s like OJ money. All he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror. That’s all it would’ve took. Because only a black dude in the United States can look at other dudes and be like, “I think the police did this shit.” He’s fucked up in the game. That’s how OJ got off.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’ve been watching that new OJ show. I can’t get enough of that shit. Doesn’t it bring back good memories? But I forgot just how polarizing that OJ case was. And you know, I’ve met OJ Simpson on four different occasions in my life. And before the end of the show, I will tell you about each of those occasions. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>The first time I met OJ Simpson</strong></span>, I was in Santa Monica. -Santa Monica! -Yeah! I can’t believe a black dude was like, “Santa Monica!” You the last n i g g a I would expect to say that. Let me see your shoes. You got some Vans on, n i g g a? What you got? “Santa Monica!” You? At the time, I was . I had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, “Hey, OJ Simpson’s here, and he said he wants to meet you.” I said, “What? Fuck yeah!” I ran down the steps, and OJ was down there. He’s like, “Hey, young man. How are you? It’s very good to meet you. And you’re doing really good work, and I hope good things happen for you in your life.” I was like, “Man, thanks, Mr. Juice.” Standing beside him, was– I don’t know the nice way to say this– his soon-to-be-slain wife. Ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show. Just man the fuck up. She’s dead. We already know what happened. We don’t know who did it, but we know what happened. I should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. She actually embraced me. She said, “I think you’re adorable,” and she hugged me. She goes, “Good luck to you,” and she held me for a long time. And I whispered in her ear, “Bitch, are you trying to get us both killed?” I’m just kidding. I didn’t say that, but… that was the first time, in a nutshell.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities. Very diverse crowd. Looks like you thought Bernie Sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker. But… surprise! It’s me. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I’m happy, really, to see black people come. A lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to. But there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows. One is because, obviously, black people have slower Internet connections. I mean, that would be my guess. I don’t know what– Actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community I hold so dear.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A couple of weeks ago, I was supposed to be in <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Flint, Michigan</strong></span>, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in Flint. I don’t know if you know this, but the water in Flint is fucking poisonous. It’s actually making people sick. Hollywood people are like, “So what? At least they have water.” But this water– this water is fucked up. So, a lot of black celebrities flew into Flint, and they did a tremendous charity benefit, and I was on the schedule to appear.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Uh… So, the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Oscars</strong></span>. Right, I know. So, I was on my way to the airport to go to Flint, and then Chris Rock calls me and is like, “Hey, Dave, I got a ticket for you for the Oscars. Can you make it?” And I was like, “Sure, n i g g a. I’m on my way to the airport right now.” Come on, man. What am I gonna do about that water? What am I, a fucking superhero? I need to have fun. I need to live, too! I didn’t fuck that water up! Stevie Wonder was there. They didn’t need me. I’m sorry, everybody. I’d never been to the Oscars. You’ve seen the movies I make. I was excited.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I knew I was gonna get into some trouble, because when I was walking on the red carpet, the <strong>black press</strong> came after me. “Excuse me, brother.” When you hear somebody call you “brother” too much, something terrible is about to happen. “Excuse me, brother. Brother?” And I looked back, and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie. I said, “Uh-oh.” He said, “I just want to ask you a couple questions.” I said, “What publication are you with?” He said, “Me? I’m with <strong><em>The Daily Bongo</em></strong>.” I said, “<em>Daily Bongo</em>? What the fuck? Who the fuck reads this?” He said, “Listen, brother, I just want to ask you a quick question. You understand that this year, this is a boycott for the Oscars. So, I’m just wondering what made you, of all people, cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight.” I said, “Boycott? N i g g a, I haven’t been working in ten years. What do you mean, boycott? I’ve been on strike. Y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working. I had to watch fucking Key and Peele do my show every night! So, fuck <em>The Daily Bongo</em>,” is what I said. I went to the Oscars and had a wonderful time. I went in that fucking green room. It was filled with so many stars, I couldn’t even believe what I was seeing. Hollywood was seducing me all over again. I was sitting back there. I’m smoking, drinking with the stars.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And then <strong>two Hollywood movie producers</strong> came over, right to me. “Oh, my God. Dave Chappelle,” said the leader one. He was obviously gay. Some guys, you can just tell. The other one seemed like a money guy. Maybe he was from Texas or some shit. But the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking. And then he hit me with: “So, David, um… do you have any <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>movie ideas</strong></span> that you would like to pursue?” The truth is, I don’t. But if you know the game, you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas. I was like, “Yeah, man. I got plenty of ideas.” And he called my bluff. “Really? Like what?” “Huh? Oh. Um… um…”</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And then I just started making up shit that I thought maybe he’d like to see. I said, “I have a superhero idea.” He goes, “Really?” I go, “Yeah. He’s a– He’s a gay superhero.” He was like, “Really?! What’s it called?” “Huh? Oh, it’s called– It’s called <strong>Same Hero, New Boots</strong>. It’s about a gay sous-chef in San Francisco… that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he’s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams, supersonic gay kind of powers. And he starts saving everybody in San Francisco. But at first, he only saves gay people. Later, he saves everybody, and the whole city just falls in love with him. The only problem is, no one remembers him when he saves them.” “Well, I don’t understand. Why wouldn’t they remember him?” I said, “Because, dummy, he’s gay. He keeps changing his outfit. People come up– ‘Thanks for saving me, sir. What’s your name anyway?’ He’s like, ‘Same Hero, New Boots!’ And that motherfucker flies away.”</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He was like, “I like it a lot.” The Texan didn’t like that shit at all. He was upset. “That’s impossible, a gay superhero.” I said, “What? Well, I have others. <strong>I have a superhero you’d love</strong>, ’cause he’s stronger than Superman and he fights for truth, justice and the American way, like Superman, but more than Superman. He beats up Mexicans for no reason.” The Texan’s like, “You got my attention.” I’m like, “Man, this motherfucker’s so strong, he can fly and do all this great shit. Only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina. Not a long touch, just a couple of pats.” He said, “Well, what’s the problem with that?” I said, “The problem, sir, is that our hero is not a handsome man. And he’s often short on cash. So, whenever trouble breaks out, he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas. ‘Please, miss! That building’s on fire. Can I pat your vagina? Quickly. People are dying!’ But he can’t tell them exactly why. ‘Eww! Get away! You’re gross!’ ‘Please, miss! People are dying! Just a couple of pats!’ ‘Eww! Gross! Get away!’ So, he rapes them.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know, I know. That’s the dilemma for the audience. Because he rapes, but he saves a lot of lives. And he saves way more than he rapes, and he only rapes to save. But he does rape.” I didn’t realize it, but the whole green room was looking at us. All the celebrities were disgusted. “Ohh.” That guy from Texas was like, “Here’s my card. Call me on Monday.” That worked out.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>The second time I met OJ Simpson</strong></span>. It was right after the trial of the century. There I was, now a young man of probably 23. OJ Simpson was the most famous, or infamous, face on planet Earth. I was in a restaurant in Beverly Hills with my agents. I wasn’t alone in the restaurant, but I was alone. I was the only black person in the restaurant. And in the 90’s, that felt very uncomfortable. Now I tend to enjoy it at this age. I was having dinner with my agents, celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative, but I later learned fucking sucked. And suddenly, a group of women walked by. Every race was in that group. Black, white, Asian, Latina, white, white… and white again. They were all gorgeous. I watched them walk by. Then I saw a familiar face. Al Cowlings, the man from the infamous Bronco chase, walked by and embraced one of the women, and they walked towards the door. Couldn’t believe what I saw. And then, close behind him, was OJ Simpson, newly released from jail. The restaurant fell still. I was shocked. I didn’t mean to say it out loud, but it just came out. “OJ!” He stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. I was sitting in the corner of the booth. He leaned over all the white people I was having dinner with and shook my hand. “How are you, young man?” He looked in my eyes, and I could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time. And then he walked away. And I looked back at my agents, and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. And the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named Sharon who used to represent me. “How could you?” she said. “How could you shake hands with that murderer?” I said, “Sharon, with all due respect, that murderer ran for over 11,000 yards. And he was acquitted. So, you know, fuck it. The glove didn’t fit. The glove didn’t fit. Get over yourself.” Some people can’t do that.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some people just can’t get over themselves. Gay people have a hard time doing that recently. Here we go. Here comes the deep water. No, recently I’ve noticed that. I noticed it with that <strong>Manny Pacquiao controversy</strong>. Yeah, it was– Now, in the gay community’s defense, Manny Pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people, very not nice things that I won’t repeat, but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals. It wasn’t a good look. Nike took his shoes immediately. Which I thought was a little harsh. A little harsh, you know what I mean? Just ’cause he’s Asian. You know what I mean? How the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an Asian dude to appease a gay dude? You know what I mean? No? You don’t know what I mean. But Asian people kind of know what I mean. No? No Asians in the front? No? No, this is what I mean. Look, you’re an Asian dude– I say this with no disrespect.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We’re all Americans, right? And we can agree that America has a huge body count all over the world, but nowhere more than Asia. Literally, if you look at history, recently, we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent. We dropped two atomic bombs on fucking Japan, and they’ve been drawing Hello Kitty and shit ever since. There’s a lot of lady-boys in the wake of our bombs. And I know these things because my wife is Asian. She’s Filipino. All right, okay. So, that explains it. Now you know why you see me at all those Filipino events. I’m not there picking up pussy. I’m dropping some off. I take my wife to all that shit. I took my wife to see Pacquiao fight Mayweather. We sat ringside, okay? That– Yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, that’s what that was.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But if you know what’s popping in the Philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the Philippines growing up without their mothers. Yes. A lot of women in the Philippines go to the Arabian Peninsula, they come to the United States, they make all their money here, they send all that money back home, which is still one of the number-one staples in the Philippines’ economy– money that the expats send back to the Philippines. The men, on the other hand, are left rearing children, twiddling their thumbs, waiting on their wives’ checks. These men have been fucking emasculated.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And then suddenly, a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist. This is not the guy you’re supposed to ask, “What do you think of homosexuals?” He’s not your champ. Shit. That’s why I don’t have a sneaker deal, ’cause if you say something that people don’t like, they’ll take your fucking shoes off.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If Martin Luther King had a sneaker deal, we’d still be on the back of the bus. It’s true. The Nike exec would come up– “Hi, Martin. Uh… we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans. It’s upsetting our Southern distributors.” “But I don’t understand. I thought that’s why I had a sneaker deal in the first place.” “Not quite. Really, it’s a walking shoe. And we like the marching, but… Try to understand.” Fuck that shit.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You know, I get it, though. I understand why gay people are mad, and I empathize. You know what? I’m just telling you this as a black dude. I support your movement. But if you want to take some advice from a Negro, pace yourself. These things take a while. Just ’cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it. Brown v.

       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Somebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last Wednesday. It takes a minute. <strong>My wife’s friend Stewart</strong> told me that. My wife has a lot of gay friends. Stewart’s their leader. She has a lot of gay friends. And I don’t like ’em. Not ’cause they’re gay. I’m just judging them on the merits of their character. They’re just not nice dudes. They’re fucking rude houseguests. They’re sitting on my couch, giggling with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons. Then I come in, and they act like the party’s over. “Hey, Stewart. What’s going on?” This guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk. “Hi, David.” “Stewart, what’s all the beef, man? What’s going–” He always wants to have some kind of gay political argument. The last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words “husband and wife” out of the law. I said, “Why would you want those words out of the law?” He said, “Because it discriminates against same-sex couples.” I was like, “N i g g a s, please, save me the semantics. Just trust me. Take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino. You’re about to crap out! Just go outside, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, that’s the wife.” No, no. Stewart didn’t like that. Stewart educates me about this movement. I didn’t even know shit about it. He told me it’s called “LBGTQ!” I was like, “What the fuck is the ‘Q’?” Does that even make sense? “Q”? Turns out “Q” is like the vowels. That shit is sometimes “Y.” It’s for gay dudes that don’t really know they’re gay. Like prison fags who are like, “What? I’m not gay, n i g g a. I’m just sucking these dicks to pass the time. I’m not ‘G.’ I’m ‘Q.’ Ugh.” I think– Okay, again, of all those letters, the “T” has the toughest road ahead. In fact, I think the “T” should stand for “Tough road ahead.”</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They’ve got the longest mental gap to bridge. That’s all I’m saying. Because whenever I see one of them Ts on the street, I don’t mind them, but I’ll be like, <strong>“Man, I miss Bruce.”</strong> I’m sorry, guys. I’m 42. I remember Bruce Jenner. Before the Kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white American superhero. It was amazing. He was beating Africans at track and field. We’d never seen anything like it. He was on my cereal box growing up. You know how much of that cereal I ate? N i g g a, I didn’t know he was gonna do that. I knew before you guys knew. I heard things on the street in Hollywood. You’d just be out, see people. “Hey, what’s up, Kanye? Why the long face?” “N i g g a, you’ll see. I got two mother-in-laws now.” And when I heard he was gonna do it, I was scared. I didn’t think the public was ready. I didn’t think the media was ready. And you know what? I was wrong. Not only did the public embrace him, but the media was nice. I’d never seen anything like it. “Welcome to the world, Caitlyn. So long, Bruce. Hello, Caitlyn.” I was shocked! Is this happening?</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wait a minute. Is this a time in American history where an American can make a decision for themselves, and even though other Americans don’t understand it, they’ll support it and let this person live a happy life? Is this what’s happening? If it is, then good for America. That’s Dave Chappelle, the American. Although, Dave Chappelle, the black American, he was a little jealous. I was like, <strong>“How the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination Olympics?”</strong> If the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year, there’d be a fucking war in LA. I know black dudes in Brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe. Transgenders are gangsters. I used to do business with a transgender in Hollywood. Man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom. She’d walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse. Wouldn’t say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit. Then she’d walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table. “Let’s talk business, gentlemen.” “Aaah!” Shit is scary as fuck. If your best friend pitched that to you, you’d be horrified. “Yo, n i g g a, let’s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits.” “What?! Can’t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something? You sure that’s what you want to do?” “There’s only way to find out, n i g g a. Wu-Tang! Pow! Pow! Let’s go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us. Yeah.”</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>The third time I met OJ Simpson</strong></span>— The third time I met OJ Simpson, I was doing great in life. I’d just finished the second season of <i>Chappelle’s Show.</i> Man, those were good days. I was playing a comedy club in Miami, The Improv. I don’t know if you’ve ever been, but if you have, you’d know the door for the green room is right on the stage. Can you imagine such a thing? If I walked out of the door of the green room, bam, I was right here, right from the dressing room. And I did that. I walked out, and the whole crowd was like, “Hooray!” And I looked– ma’am, as close as you are to me– I saw him as soon as I came out: The Juice. And I saw recognition in his eyes, and it filled me with pride that he knew who I was. I didn’t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience, and I didn’t want to start a panic. But I did my show. The show went great. I said, “Good night, everyone.” They all said, “Yay!” And I didn’t say nothing to OJ, but I just gave him the signal to let him know I knew he was there. And I walked into the green room, and OJ was already in there! I was like, “How the fuck is this possible?” I was scared. And then my friends came in, and we all started talking. We sat down on the couch. And I’m just telling you what I saw with my own eyes. You can believe me or not believe me. But in my experience, OJ Simpson– one of the nicest men I’d ever met. He was nice to me. He was nice to my friends. The conversation was filled with warmth and levity, humor and wisdom. We talked for minutes, and then suddenly, the Juice said, “You know what? I’ve got to be going. But it’s good to see you again, and I’m glad things went so well.” I said, “Thanks, Juice.” And my friends said, “Yeah, goodbye, Mr. Juice.” They were new to the game. He said, “No. Thank you… for your hospitality. Good night, guys.<i>“</i> And we said, “Good night.” And he just walked out of the room. And as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like, “That n i g g a did that shit. Did you feel that? I could feel like… murder in the room.”</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Well, you young heads missed that shit. <strong>You’re all too young</strong>. You don’t remember that. -How old are you, young, man? You. -Twenty-four. Twenty-four? You don’t know shit. You don’t know shit! You gotta Google shit that I lived through. See, this is why I lock motherfuckers’ phones up. Seriously. Because the young kids, you guys need to take a break from that– We all need to break just from that technology, just for a minute. You know, I’m from a different time, young man. A dark time to you. I’m from a time that I didn’t even used to know who was on the phone until I answered the shit. Like, when tragedy used to strike.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I remember I was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom. You remember these days? And she turned it on to one of three channels. And she said, “Class, <strong>the space shuttle</strong> is taking off, and we’re all gonna watch it take off.” Man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes. That’s right. You remember. It fucking exploded! Right on television. Everybody on board, dead. Immediately presumed dead. It was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like… “You can go home.” It was a goddamn national tragedy. This was Cold War America. The Russians were laughing at us.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My point is, for a guy your age wouldn’t even know the pain, because in your generation, it’s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day. How can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing? I’m getting over one cop shooting, and then another one happens, and then another one happens, and another one happens. I’m crying about Paris, and then Brussels happens. I can’t keep track of all this shit. So you just give the fuck up. That’s the hallmark of your generation, and that’s fucked up, because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history. <strong>This is the age of spin</strong>. The age where nobody knows what the fuck they’re even looking at. Did you know that Planned Parenthood was for abortions? It’s for people that don’t plan things out at all. That’s right. So, a guy your age doesn’t really know how he feels. Are you pro-choice? Are you anti-consequences? What does it all really mean? It’s easier not to care for you. But for us, we were trained to care. We were raised that way.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I used to watch a fucking cartoon when I was growing up called <i><strong>Care Bears</strong>.</i> It was about a fucking group of teddy-bear people. They were like teddy bears, but they were like people, and they were all different colors, and they all fucking just walked around, caring. They cared about each other and everything else. They all had different designs on their stomachs, and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside. Very, very loving group of beings. And when shit got real bad, as nice as those teddy bears were, they didn’t get mean faces. They got determined. Hmm! And the leader would say, “Come on, guys. It’s time for the Care Bear Stare!” Remember that shit? And them little teddy bears would lock arms… and stare at the problem– and I’m not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests… and would dispel anything that was fucked up. And when we grew up, we wanted to be like those bears. And then we got our hearts broken, because we found out that life wasn’t gonna let us do that and that it’s impossible to shoot love out of your chest.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, I have shot love onto somebody’s chest before. I do it all the time. It’s the next best thing. You kids don’t know. Your generation is just determined to be angry, mad. Everybody’s mad. Back when we were growing up, only black people were mad. Now everybody’s just trying to get in on the act. I try to think to myself, <strong>“When did everyone get mad?”</strong> And then I realize this happened before we were born. This is a long way to go, but… it probably started in the Second World War. Think about it. All these black men, millions of black men, leave the United States for the first time, go over to Europe with America’s Armed Forces and fight the Nazis and make more money fighting Nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the United States. And a lot of those men, while they were in Europe– just to be real, not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women. I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen. This was <strong>World War II Europe</strong>, and these were desperate times, and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things. And it’s very hard to come back to America and sit on the back of the bus after you’ve been in the South of France, getting your dick sucked for a Crunch bar or some crazy shit like that. That’s a life-changing experience. And while that was happening in Europe, here in America, for the first time, <strong>women</strong> entered the workforce en masse, by the millions. All the men were gone. Someone had to run the factory. The ladies did it. That’s right. This was the first generation of American women to have independent income en masse, and when the men came back, the women weren’t the same. American women had grown. They were uttering phrases that no woman on Earth had ever spoken before, things like, “No” and “Shut the fuck up” and “I don’t feel like it.”</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agency that started <strong>testing mind control drugs</strong> on the American public. They fucked up. They tested it for 12 years. They didn’t realize these drugs were not mind-controlling. They were mind-expanding. It was LSD and mescaline and shit like that. And for the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in. By 1960, the <strong>President of the United States</strong> was only 42 years old. Can you imagine? DMX is older than that. And he was gonna usher in a new era of peace. He was gonna avoid the Cold War. He was gonna end segregation. And they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in Dallas. This country was never the same. There were seven more major <strong>assassinations in the ’60s</strong>. Anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog. Kennedy, Kennedy, King, X, Evers, on and on. You didn’t even have to be famous. You could be a college student at Kent State, or in Mississippi, protesting the Vietnam War, and they shot them, too.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The ’70s</strong> were a wild era. And while all this was going on… <strong>Bill Cosby raped 54 people</strong>. Holy shit. That’s a lot of rapes, man. This guy’s putting up real numbers. He’s like the Steph Curry of rape. Man, that’s a lot of rapes. Fifty-four? If he had raped less people… that’s still two dozen rapes! Don’t forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s over hours of rape. It only takes hours to get a pilot’s license. If rapes were aircrafts, this n i g g a is Top Gun for sure.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yeah, that’s a tough one. And I was onstage not too long ago. I was in <strong>Syracuse, New York</strong>. Yeah. Well, yeah, for Syracuse. But the show didn’t go so good… all because I was talking about Bill Cosby a little bit. Not a little bit. I’ll be honest. I talked about him for like, minutes. And a woman stood up in the back of the room, and she screamed out, “You are a fucking asshole for saying these things!” “I know.” Instantly, I felt bad. Not bad about what I was saying. I just felt bad like, “Oh, that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show.” I didn’t realize it at first, but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. By the time I saw her, I just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. I was horrified. I said, “Oh, my God! I’m gonna kick this bitch in the face.” Lucky for me, I didn’t have to. Security tackled her. But it was a really fucking horrifying scene. A scuffle ensued. And then, finally, she screamed out to me, <strong>“Women suffer!”</strong> I said, “I know.” And, ladies, I need you to know… that I know. I need you to know. Seriously, there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. I would include myself in that. Don’t ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. There’s a lot of men like that in this room. There’s a lot of men like that in the world. Or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass n i g g a s. But as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, I started to take offense. And I’ll be honest, race was involved. She was a young white woman. Well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through. “Bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?” She didn’t get it. She just kept going. “Women suffer!” “I know.” “Women suffer!” “Same team.” “Women suffer!” “I know.” And this is when she went too far: “We suffer just like you.” “Slow your roll, bitch. You suffer, yes, but not like me. Not like us.” She goes, “Suffering is suffering. What’s the difference?” I said, “Come on, white woman, you know what it is. You was in on the heist. You just don’t like your cut.” You suffer, I suffer. You suffer, I suffer. That’s how it works.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Can’t do <strong>comparative suffering</strong>. If you’re hungry, and your friend says, “You know, people are starving in Africa,” “So what, n i g g a? I still want lunch.” Black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that it’s a fucking dead-end game. Blacks and Jews do that shit to each other all the time. You ever played Who Suffered More with a Jewish person? It’s a tough game. Whenever you think you’ve got the Jewish guy on the ropes, that motherfucker will be like, “Well, don’t forget about Egypt.” “Egypt?! God damn, n i g g a, I didn’t know we was going all the way back to Egypt.” What the fuck is wrong with her? What does she think? Does she think that I don’t know that rape is wrong? Does she think that maybe I don’t have empathy for Bill Cosby’s alleged victims? And I would be remiss if I didn’t remind you that technically these are all still allegations. Although, I admit it looks very bad. Perhaps if she looked at it correctly, she would have empathy for me, the man she was attacking, a 42-year-old black comedian.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Obviously, Bill Cosby was a hero to me. And she doesn’t know what it feels like to think that your hero might’ve done something so heinous, my God, you can’t imagine. It’d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself… had raped 54 people. You’d say to yourself, “Oh, man, but I like chocolate ice cream. I don’t want it to rape.” Didn’t want to believe it. At first, I didn’t believe it. I said, “These people are obviously trying to destroy Dr. Cosby’s rich legacy.” Even 34 allegations into it, I was still like, “Man… he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people.” I know, I know. But it’s really tough.</p>,\n",
       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You guys are young. Imagine if you found out 40 years from now that <strong>Kevin Hart</strong> raped 54 people. You’d be like, “Oh, my God.” The only one that would believe that would be Katt Williams. He’d be like, “I knew that motherfucker was up to something! I knew Kevin had raped those people.” You know, I was mad at Kevin, too, though. You know why? Okay, first of all, I didn’t even know Kevin was as successful as he was. I found that shit out the hard way. I was at home when my son busted in. He said, “Dad, I need $250.” He’s only years old, so I freaked out. “What’s going on, n i g g a? Is somebody trying to kill you?” He said, “No, no. Kevin Hart’s coming to town, and I wanted to see his show.” I said, “How much are the tickets?” He said, “They’re $125.” I said, “God damn! Mine are only 80.” I said, “Why do you need $250, then?” He goes, “Because I want to go with you, Dad. Please? And there it is. So, I took him to the show. And we go, we sit right up front. The lights go down, and one opening act after another goes on. Then Kevin takes the stage. The crowd goes fucking nuts. Thousands of people. I was furious. The longer the show went on, the madder I got. Because his show was fucking outstanding. It was maddening. These people were fucking holding their stomachs. My son was slapping his knee. I’m like, “Damn, n i g g a, I do this, too.” Kevin says, “Good night.” The crowd goes crazy. And then everyone starts walking to his door, and the lights come on, and then my son is just standing there, looking at an empty stage. People are pushing past me, and nobody’s recognizing me. I’m like, “Man, this place fucking sucks!” I said, “Come on, son, let’s get out of here.” Then my son looks back at me and says, “Dad, please. Please, I have to meet him.” I was like, “Oh, my God.” So, I took him backstage. I’ve known Kevin for years, but can you believe I was scared to knock on his dressing room door? I almost said… “Son, I haven’t seen him for a long time.” And one of Kevin’s goons opened the door. “Hey, what’s up, Dave Chappelle? What are you doing, man? It’s good to see you, brother. What are you doing in this area? This is a terrible area.” I’m like, “Actually, I live around here. Listen… is Kevin here? My son just wanted to meet him real quick.” “I don’t know, ’cause Kevin’s about to eat dinner.” Just then, Kevin came around the corner to see who it was. “What? Oh, shit! What’s up, Dave? Come on back. I was just about to have dinner. I don’t know if you guys ate, but you’re welcome to join me if you’d like.” And then my son pushed passed me. It was some cold shit. He goes, “Actually, Mr. Hart, we haven’t eaten in several hours.” Man, Kevin took us into his back room. This guy had a fucking spread. It was Tuesday night. This motherfucker was having Sunday dinner. There were steaks, chops, corn with butter all over it. My son was eating all fast, embarrassing me. I was like, “Slow down, son.” He was like… Then I looked over in the corner, and there was a box of custom-made jerseys for the local team. Each one was hand-stitched, and on the back, they stitched on “K-Hart” on all of them. Kevin saw me staring at that box, and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys, and he walked right to my son. He said, “Hey, little man. I want you to have this.” And my son was like, “Thanks, Mr. Hart.” This is when I got mad. He goes, “If your father ever makes you mad, put that on.” And he walked out. Oh, that was some cold shit. Then I realized– I looked up what Kevin made on Google. I couldn’t believe that shit. Kevin is the first comedian that a Drake song could be about. Kevin could walk around his house and sing “All Me,” and the whole song would still be true.</p>,\n",

       " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let’s not forget. Let’s not forget. I’ve never met Bill Cosby, so I’m not defending him. Let’s just remember that he has a <strong>valuable legacy</strong> that I can’t just throw away. I remember that he’s the first black man to ever win an Emmy in television. I also remember that he’s the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately. I remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the Super Bowl every Thursday night. And I remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of African-Americans on his show. I’m telling you, that’s no small thing. I’ve had a television show. I wouldn’t have done that shit. He gave tens of millions of dollars to African-American institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college. Not just the ones he raped. Here comes the kicker. You ready? Here’s the fact that I heard, but haven’t confirmed. I heard that when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a PA system that Bill Cosby paid for. So, you understand what I’m saying? The point is this: He rapes, but he saves. And he saves more than he rapes. But he probably does rape. Thank you very much! Good night!</p>,\n",

The fourth time is not the funniest time, but it was the last time I’d see the Juice. For some reason, I was at the Kentucky Derby. It’s a very long story. <i>This is right after I quit Chappelle’s Show</i> in spectacular fashion. There was a party hosted by Michael Jordan, and every athlete I’ve ever admired was in that room. Yes. And then I saw a familiar face by the bar, standing there, drinking alone. It was Chris Tucker. Now… you have to remember, at this time, we were both technically missing. And we went over, and we’re talking with one another, and motherfuckers were amazed to see us together. Seeing me and Chris Tucker at that point would be like seeing Bigfoot riding a unicorn. You wouldn’t believe that’s what you were seeing. And then, through all the gawkers, a familiar face pushed through the crowd. Here he was again. The Juice. He had his camera ready. He was like, “Dave, Chris. Good to see you guys. Hey, come on, guys. Let’s all get together for a picture.” And at the same time, me and Chris were like, “No. I can’t do that. Sorry, Juice, my career is too flimsy to survive a picture with you.” That’s the end. Good night.</p>,\n",

I want to thank everyone in LA for a wonderful week. It’s been great here. You know what? It’s been ten years since the last time I played Los Angeles, if you can imagine. I know! I know, I’ve been gone for a very long time. And unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years. I’m not gonna take you through all the agony I’ve been through, but it was tough. Some of it you might’ve seen.',\n",
       " 'I don’t know if you ever saw on TMZ the big headline: “Dave Chappelle Drunk Onstage in Detroit.” Well, if you saw it, I wasn’t drunk. I had smoked some reefer… with some rappers. Yeah. I don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong, stronger than I what I was accustomed to. The article goes on to say I was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. I was booed. I did not leave. It was a long bomb. It was a fucking nightmare. Two puffs of weed, that’s all it was. Two puffs. I never had that happen, where I take two puffs of weed, I looked at the guy next to me, I was like, “I’m gonna bomb, n i g g a. I can feel it.” And that guy called my name. “Dave Chappelle!” N i g g a s was like… Normally, when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here, but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… That’s how the show started. Didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like, “What the fuck?” They started looking amongst themselves. So I knew I wasn’t doing good. I don’t remember what I was saying. It just took one person to break the ice. It was a black lady with a Ford Motor shirt on. Stood up suddenly. “Fuck you, Dave Chappelle!” I said, “Excuse me?” She said, “I worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!” And in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. “Yeah!” The whole crowd banded together and started chanting, “We want our money back! We want our money back!” I said, “Oh, shit.” I snapped out of it. “Good people of Detroit, hear me. Hear me now. You will never get your fucking money back.” Fuck that. I said, “I’m like Evel Knievel. I get paid for the attempt. I didn’t promise this shit would be good.” “Boo!” They said, “Fuck you!”',\n",
       " 'This went on for a long time. And then, after the show, I felt so bad, I took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– I said, “I’m gonna give this to charity.” You know what I did? I bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around Detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. I was very mad at Detroit that night. Because not only did I bomb, I had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again. Fucking nightmare.',\n",
       " 'That would be like if you were having sex with a woman and, for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason, she had a mousetrap in her pussy. You get caught in the trap. And then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night. I’d still do it, but I’d be careful the next time. The old mousetrap-in-the-pussy trick, eh? Fool me once. Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough time. And I wanted to give up sometimes. I almost did give up, but then, right before I gave up, I decided not to. But I made the call. They answered the phone. “Hello? Dancing with the Stars.” I said, “Not yet. Not yet.” Yeah. If you see me on that shit, it’s over. Trust me. My spirit is broken. If you see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my cha-cha, fuck that.',\n",
       " 'I’ve been hanging out in– I haven’t been working in LA, but I come out here and hang out and shit. I was out here a few weeks ago. I almost got arrested. I’m not bullshitting. This happens to a lot of black people. What happened was… I was coming out of one of those nightclubs in Hollywood, and my friend saw me. I guess I was wobbling or something. So, he just rolled up. He’s a good friend of mine. He’s like, “Hey, Dave, give me the keys.” I was like, “All right, n i g g a, just take the keys.” And I got in the passenger’s side of my car, and he drove it. It was fine. Just talking, chopping it up. And then, on the 10, the blue-and-whites hit us. Now, I should tell you, the friend that was driving me was black, which really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car. Not my fear. I’m black, but I’m also Dave Chappelle. So, I figured, you know, shit will probably be fine. Traffic stop started off on the right foot. The cops came up to the driver’s side. “Hi. How are you guys doing tonight?” And he recognized me immediately. “Oh. Dave Chappelle.” And I looked at my friend like, “We’re getting out of this shit.” And then he says, “You guys were swerving in the lane. Do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second?” Still no cause for alarm. I looked through the rearview mirror. The body language of the arrest looked good. Just talking. So, then I started fucking with the radio. You know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car. But then, when I looked back in the rearview mirror, something had gone horribly wrong. That motherfucker was back there like… And the next thing I knew, they were stuffing him in the back of the car, and I thought what anybody would think in a situation like that: “Oh, my God. What is gonna happen to me?” And the police walked up to the window. “Mr. Chappelle, we had to arrest your friend. He refused to take our breathalyzer test.” I said, “That motherfucker. Not complying? That’s odd. So, officer, what’s gonna happen to me?” “You’re fine. We’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle, and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home.” I said, “Oh, well, no. I would rather you just give me the keys.” He said, “Mr. Chappelle, your friend already told us he’s your designated driver. We can’t let you drive in this condition.” I was like, “No, n i g g a, I’m good.” And then suddenly, the shit turned into Vegas. He was like… “I’ll let you blow for it.” I said, “Excuse me?” He said, “If you blow in my breathalyzer–” I said, “Oh, n i g g a, I thought you was trying to get your dick sucked. What’s the– Whew! Whew!” “If you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, I’ll give you the keys to the car.” I said, “Uh… set ’em up, n i g g a. Let’s play.” And I blew in that thing. And it made a noise. “Beep!” I said, “Uh-oh.” And he looked at it. He said, “Oh, well, Mr. Chappelle, I guess you’re free to go.” I said, “I am?” I didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed. I drove home on the miles an hour. Yeah, it all worked out. It all worked out. I’m one of the lucky ones.',\n",
       " 'It doesn’t work out that well for everybody. I saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in LA in traffic. You see that shit on rush hour traffic? They beat a black woman’s ass. This woman didn’t even do anything wrong. It’s fucked up. It was so fucked up, it didn’t even go to court. The City of L.A. just gave that woman $1.5 million for her pain and suffering. That is not bad, considering that’s the same amount of money that Marcos Maidana made to fight Floyd Mayweather the second time. And this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life. You can see it on the tape. She didn’t come to fight. Her guards were low. She was taking a lot of shots.',\n",
       " 'Everybody’s mad at police now. I watched that– You see that shit on Netflix, Making a Murderer? The Steven Avery story. If you haven’t seen it, check it out. Steven Avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the United States has ever been in! In a justice system designed for him to thrive, he’s failed miserably twice. I can’t even wrap my mind around it. If Making a Murderer was about a black dude, that shit would be called Duh! Of course everything would go wrong. Seems like he did it, all right. The motherfucker even had $200,000 for his legal defense. That should get you off in Wisconsin. That’s like OJ money. All he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror. That’s all it would’ve took. Because only a black dude in the United States can look at other dudes and be like, “I think the police did this shit.” He’s fucked up in the game. That’s how OJ got off.',\n",
       " 'I’ve been watching that new OJ show. I can’t get enough of that shit. Doesn’t it bring back good memories? But I forgot just how polarizing that OJ case was. And you know, I’ve met OJ Simpson on four different occasions in my life. And before the end of the show, I will tell you about each of those occasions. The first time I met OJ Simpson, I was in Santa Monica. -Santa Monica! -Yeah! I can’t believe a black dude was like, “Santa Monica!” You the last n i g g a I would expect to say that. Let me see your shoes. You got some Vans on, n i g g a? What you got? “Santa Monica!” You? At the time, I was . I had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, “Hey, OJ Simpson’s here, and he said he wants to meet you.” I said, “What? Fuck yeah!” I ran down the steps, and OJ was down there. He’s like, “Hey, young man. How are you? It’s very good to meet you. And you’re doing really good work, and I hope good things happen for you in your life.” I was like, “Man, thanks, Mr. Juice.” Standing beside him, was– I don’t know the nice way to say this– his soon-to-be-slain wife. Ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show. Just man the fuck up. She’s dead. We already know what happened. We don’t know who did it, but we know what happened. I should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. She actually embraced me. She said, “I think you’re adorable,” and she hugged me. She goes, “Good luck to you,” and she held me for a long time. And I whispered in her ear, “Bitch, are you trying to get us both killed?” I’m just kidding. I didn’t say that, but… that was the first time, in a nutshell.',\n",
       " 'It’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities. Very diverse crowd. Looks like you thought Bernie Sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker. But… surprise! It’s me. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I’m happy, really, to see black people come. A lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to. But there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows. One is because, obviously, black people have slower Internet connections. I mean, that would be my guess. I don’t know what– Actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community I hold so dear.',\n",
       " 'A couple of weeks ago, I was supposed to be in Flint, Michigan, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in Flint. I don’t know if you know this, but the water in Flint is fucking poisonous. It’s actually making people sick. Hollywood people are like, “So what? At least they have water.” But this water– this water is fucked up. So, a lot of black celebrities flew into Flint, and they did a tremendous charity benefit, and I was on the schedule to appear.',\n",
       " 'Uh… So, the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the Oscars. Right, I know. So, I was on my way to the airport to go to Flint, and then Chris Rock calls me and is like, “Hey, Dave, I got a ticket for you for the Oscars. Can you make it?” And I was like, “Sure, n i g g a. I’m on my way to the airport right now.” Come on, man. What am I gonna do about that water? What am I, a fucking superhero? I need to have fun. I need to live, too! I didn’t fuck that water up! Stevie Wonder was there. They didn’t need me. I’m sorry, everybody. I’d never been to the Oscars. You’ve seen the movies I make. I was excited.',\n",
       " 'I knew I was gonna get into some trouble, because when I was walking on the red carpet, the black press came after me. “Excuse me, brother.” When you hear somebody call you “brother” too much, something terrible is about to happen. “Excuse me, brother. Brother?” And I looked back, and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie. I said, “Uh-oh.” He said, “I just want to ask you a couple questions.” I said, “What publication are you with?” He said, “Me? I’m with The Daily Bongo.” I said, “Daily Bongo? What the fuck? Who the fuck reads this?” He said, “Listen, brother, I just want to ask you a quick question. You understand that this year, this is a boycott for the Oscars. So, I’m just wondering what made you, of all people, cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight.” I said, “Boycott? N i g g a, I haven’t been working in ten years. What do you mean, boycott? I’ve been on strike. Y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working. I had to watch fucking Key and Peele do my show every night! So, fuck The Daily Bongo,” is what I said. I went to the Oscars and had a wonderful time. I went in that fucking green room. It was filled with so many stars, I couldn’t even believe what I was seeing. Hollywood was seducing me all over again. I was sitting back there. I’m smoking, drinking with the stars.',\n",
       " 'And then two Hollywood movie producers came over, right to me. “Oh, my God. Dave Chappelle,” said the leader one. He was obviously gay. Some guys, you can just tell. The other one seemed like a money guy. Maybe he was from Texas or some shit. But the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking. And then he hit me with: “So, David, um… do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue?” The truth is, I don’t. But if you know the game, you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas. I was like, “Yeah, man. I got plenty of ideas.” And he called my bluff. “Really? Like what?” “Huh? Oh. Um… um…”',\n",
       " 'And then I just started making up shit that I thought maybe he’d like to see. I said, “I have a superhero idea.” He goes, “Really?” I go, “Yeah. He’s a– He’s a gay superhero.” He was like, “Really?! What’s it called?” “Huh? Oh, it’s called– It’s called Same Hero, New Boots. It’s about a gay sous-chef in San Francisco… that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he’s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams, supersonic gay kind of powers. And he starts saving everybody in San Francisco. But at first, he only saves gay people. Later, he saves everybody, and the whole city just falls in love with him. The only problem is, no one remembers him when he saves them.” “Well, I don’t understand. Why wouldn’t they remember him?” I said, “Because, dummy, he’s gay. He keeps changing his outfit. People come up– ‘Thanks for saving me, sir. What’s your name anyway?’ He’s like, ‘Same Hero, New Boots!’ And that motherfucker flies away.”',\n",
       " 'He was like, “I like it a lot.” The Texan didn’t like that shit at all. He was upset. “That’s impossible, a gay superhero.” I said, “What? Well, I have others. I have a superhero you’d love, ’cause he’s stronger than Superman and he fights for truth, justice and the American way, like Superman, but more than Superman. He beats up Mexicans for no reason.” The Texan’s like, “You got my attention.” I’m like, “Man, this motherfucker’s so strong, he can fly and do all this great shit. Only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina. Not a long touch, just a couple of pats.” He said, “Well, what’s the problem with that?” I said, “The problem, sir, is that our hero is not a handsome man. And he’s often short on cash. So, whenever trouble breaks out, he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas. ‘Please, miss! That building’s on fire. Can I pat your vagina? Quickly. People are dying!’ But he can’t tell them exactly why. ‘Eww! Get away! You’re gross!’ ‘Please, miss! People are dying! Just a couple of pats!’ ‘Eww! Gross! Get away!’ So, he rapes them.',\n",

OJ Simpson was the most famous, or infamous, face on planet Earth. I was in a restaurant in Beverly Hills with my agents. I wasn’t alone in the restaurant, but I was alone. I was the only black person in the restaurant. And in the 90’s, that felt very uncomfortable. Now I tend to enjoy it at this age. I was having dinner with my agents, celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative, but I later learned fucking sucked. And suddenly, a group of women walked by. Every race was in that group. Black, white, Asian, Latina, white, white… and white again. They were all gorgeous. I watched them walk by. Then I saw a familiar face. Al Cowlings, the man from the infamous Bronco chase, walked by and embraced one of the women, and they walked towards the door. Couldn’t believe what I saw. And then, close behind him, was OJ Simpson, newly released from jail. The restaurant fell still. I was shocked. I didn’t mean to say it out loud, but it just came out. “OJ!” He stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. I was sitting in the corner of the booth. He leaned over all the white people I was having dinner with and shook my hand. “How are you, young man?” He looked in my eyes, and I could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time. And then he walked away. And I looked back at my agents, and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. And the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named Sharon who used to represent me. “How could you?” she said. “How could you shake hands with that murderer?” I said, “Sharon, with all due respect, that murderer ran for over 11,000 yards. And he was acquitted. So, you know, fuck it. The glove didn’t fit. The glove didn’t fit. Get over yourself.” Some people can’t do that.',\n",

The point is this: He rapes, but he saves. And he saves more than he rapes. But he probably does rape. Thank you very much! Good night!',\n",

       " 'Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! I forgot. The fourth time I met OJ Simpson. The fourth time is not the funniest time, but it was the last time I’d see the Juice. For some reason, I was at the Kentucky Derby. It’s a very long story. This is right after I quit Chappelle’s Show in spectacular fashion. There was a party hosted by Michael Jordan, and every athlete I’ve ever admired was in that room. Yes. And then I saw a familiar face by the bar, standing there, drinking alone. It was Chris Tucker. Now… you have to remember, at this time, we were both technically missing. And we went over, and we’re talking with one another, and motherfuckers were amazed to see us together. Seeing me and Chris Tucker at that point would be like seeing Bigfoot riding a unicorn. You wouldn’t believe that’s what you were seeing. And then, through all the gawkers, a familiar face pushed through the crowd. Here he was again. The Juice. He had his camera ready. He was like, “Dave, Chris. Good to see you guys. Hey, come on, guys. Let’s all get together for a picture.” And at the same time, me and Chris were like, “No. I can’t do that. Sorry, Juice, my career is too flimsy to survive a picture with you.” That’s the end. Good night.',\n",

Thank you very much! Thank you all. Oh, wow. That was exciting, wasn’t it? Thank you, guys. Have a seat, feel comfortable, relax. I want to thank everyone in LA for a wonderful week. It’s been great here. You know what? It’s been ten years since the last time I played Los Angeles, if you can imagine. I know! I know, I’ve been gone for a very long time. And unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years. I’m not gonna take you through all the agony I’ve been through, but it was tough. Some of it you might’ve seen. I don’t know if you ever saw on TMZ the big headline: “Dave Chappelle Drunk Onstage in Detroit.” Well, if you saw it, I wasn’t drunk. I had smoked some reefer… with some rappers. Yeah. I don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong, stronger than I what I was accustomed to. The article goes on to say I was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. I was booed. I did not leave. It was a long bomb. It was a fucking nightmare. Two puffs of weed, that’s all it was. Two puffs. I never had that happen, where I take two puffs of weed, I looked at the guy next to me, I was like, “I’m gonna bomb, n i g g a. I can feel it.” And that guy called my name. “Dave Chappelle!” N i g g a s was like… Normally, when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here, but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… That’s how the show started. Didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like, “What the fuck?” They started looking amongst themselves. So I knew I wasn’t doing good. I don’t remember what I was saying. It just took one person to break the ice. It was a black lady with a Ford Motor shirt on. Stood up suddenly. “Fuck you, Dave Chappelle!” I said, “Excuse me?” She said, “I worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!” And in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. “Yeah!” The whole crowd banded together and started chanting, “We want our money back! We want our money back!” I said, “Oh, shit.” I snapped out of it. “Good people of Detroit, hear me. Hear me now. You will never get your fucking money back.” Fuck that. I said, “I’m like Evel Knievel. I get paid for the attempt. I didn’t promise this shit would be good.” “Boo!” They said, “Fuck you!” This went on for a long time. And then, after the show, I felt so bad, I took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– I said, “I’m gonna give this to charity.” You know what I did? I bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around Detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. I was very mad at Detroit that night. Because not only did I bomb, I had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again. Fucking nightmare. That would be like if you were having sex with a woman and, for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason, she had a mousetrap in her pussy. You get caught in the trap. And then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night. I’d still do it, but I’d be careful the next time. The old mousetrap-in-the-pussy trick, eh? Fool me once. Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough time. And I wanted to give up sometimes. I almost did give up, but then, right before I gave up, I decided not to. But I made the call. They answered the phone. “Hello? Dancing with the Stars.” I said, “Not yet. Not yet.” Yeah. If you see me on that shit, it’s over. Trust me. My spirit is broken. If you see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my cha-cha, fuck that. I’ve been hanging out in– I haven’t been working in LA, but I come out here and hang out and shit. I was out here a few weeks ago. I almost got arrested. I’m not bullshitting. This happens to a lot of black people. What happened was… I was coming out of one of those nightclubs in Hollywood, and my friend saw me. I guess I was wobbling or something. So, he just rolled up. He’s a good friend of mine. He’s like, “Hey, Dave, give me the keys.” I was like, “All right, n i g g a, just take the keys.” And I got in the passenger’s side of my car, and he drove it. It was fine. Just talking, chopping it up. And then, on the 10, the blue-and-whites hit us. Now, I should tell you, the friend that was driving me was black, which really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car. Not my fear. I’m black, but I’m also Dave Chappelle. So, I figured, you know, shit will probably be fine. Traffic stop started off on the right foot. The cops came up to the driver’s side. “Hi. How are you guys doing tonight?” And he recognized me immediately. “Oh. Dave Chappelle.” And I looked at my friend like, “We’re getting out of this shit.” And then he says, “You guys were swerving in the lane. Do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second?” Still no cause for alarm. I looked through the rearview mirror. The body language of the arrest looked good. Just talking. So, then I started fucking with the radio. You know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car. But then, when I looked back in the rearview mirror, something had gone horribly wrong. That motherfucker was back there like… And the next thing I knew, they were stuffing him in the back of the car, and I thought what anybody would think in a situation like that: “Oh, my God. What is gonna happen to me?” And the police walked up to the window. “Mr. Chappelle, we had to arrest your friend. He refused to take our breathalyzer test.” I said, “That motherfucker. Not complying? That’s odd. So, officer, what’s gonna happen to me?” “You’re fine. We’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle, and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home.” I said, “Oh, well, no. I would rather you just give me the keys.” He said, “Mr. Chappelle, your friend already told us he’s your designated driver. We can’t let you drive in this condition.” I was like, “No, n i g g a, I’m good.” And then suddenly, the shit turned into Vegas. He was like… “I’ll let you blow for it.” I said, “Excuse me?” He said, “If you blow in my breathalyzer–” I said, “Oh, n i g g a, I thought you was trying to get your dick sucked. What’s the– Whew! Whew!” “If you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, I’ll give you the keys to the car.” I said, “Uh… set ’em up, n i g g a. Let’s play.” And I blew in that thing. And it made a noise. “Beep!” I said, “Uh-oh.” And he looked at it. He said, “Oh, well, Mr. Chappelle, I guess you’re free to go.” I said, “I am?” I didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed. I drove home on the miles an hour. Yeah, it all worked out. It all worked out. I’m one of the lucky ones. It doesn’t work out that well for everybody. I saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in LA in traffic. You see that shit on rush hour traffic? They beat a black woman’s ass. This woman didn’t even do anything wrong. It’s fucked up. It was so fucked up, it didn’t even go to court. The City of L.A. just gave that woman $1.5 million for her pain and suffering. That is not bad, considering that’s the same amount of money that Marcos Maidana made to fight Floyd Mayweather the second time. And this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life. You can see it on the tape. She didn’t come to fight. Her guards were low. She was taking a lot of shots. Everybody’s mad at police now. I watched that– You see that shit on Netflix, Making a Murderer? The Steven Avery story. If you haven’t seen it, check it out. Steven Avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the United States has ever been in! In a justice system designed for him to thrive, he’s failed miserably twice. I can’t even wrap my mind around it. If Making a Murderer was about a black dude, that shit would be called Duh! Of course everything would go wrong. Seems like he did it, all right. The motherfucker even had $200,000 for his legal defense. That should get you off in Wisconsin. That’s like OJ money. All he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror. That’s all it would’ve took. Because only a black dude in the United States can look at other dudes and be like, “I think the police did this shit.” He’s fucked up in the game. That’s how OJ got off. I’ve been watching that new OJ show. I can’t get enough of that shit. Doesn’t it bring back good memories? But I forgot just how polarizing that OJ case was. And you know, I’ve met OJ Simpson on four different occasions in my life. And before the end of the show, I will tell you about each of those occasions. The first time I met OJ Simpson, I was in Santa Monica. -Santa Monica! -Yeah! I can’t believe a black dude was like, “Santa Monica!” You the last n i g g a I would expect to say that. Let me see your shoes. You got some Vans on, n i g g a? What you got? “Santa Monica!” You? At the time, I was . I had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, “Hey, OJ Simpson’s here, and he said he wants to meet you.” I said, “What? Fuck yeah!” I ran down the steps, and OJ was down there. He’s like, “Hey, young man. How are you? It’s very good to meet you. And you’re doing really good work, and I hope good things happen for you in your life.” I was like, “Man, thanks, Mr. Juice.” Standing beside him, was– I don’t know the nice way to say this– his soon-to-be-slain wife. Ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show. Just man the fuck up. She’s dead. We already know what happened. We don’t know who did it, but we know what happened. I should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. She actually embraced me. She said, “I think you’re adorable,” and she hugged me. She goes, “Good luck to you,” and she held me for a long time. And I whispered in her ear, “Bitch, are you trying to get us both killed?” I’m just kidding. I didn’t say that, but… that was the first time, in a nutshell. It’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities. Very diverse crowd. Looks like you thought Bernie Sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker. But… surprise! It’s me. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I’m happy, really, to see black people come. A lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to. But there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows. One is because, obviously, black people have slower Internet connections. I mean, that would be my guess. I don’t know what– Actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community I hold so dear. A couple of weeks ago, I was supposed to be in Flint, Michigan, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in Flint. I don’t know if you know this, but the water in Flint is fucking poisonous. It’s actually making people sick. Hollywood people are like, “So what? At least they have water.” But this water– this water is fucked up. So, a lot of black celebrities flew into Flint, and they did a tremendous charity benefit, and I was on the schedule to appear. Uh… So, the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the Oscars. Right, I know. So, I was on my way to the airport to go to Flint, and then Chris Rock calls me and is like, “Hey, Dave, I got a ticket for you for the Oscars. Can you make it?” And I was like, “Sure, n i g g a. I’m on my way to the airport right now.” Come on, man. What am I gonna do about that water? What am I, a fucking superhero? I need to have fun. I need to live, too! I didn’t fuck that water up! Stevie Wonder was there. They didn’t need me. I’m sorry, everybody. I’d never been to the Oscars. You’ve seen the movies I make. I was excited. I knew I was gonna get into some trouble, because when I was walking on the red carpet, the black press came after me. “Excuse me, brother.” When you hear somebody call you “brother” too much, something terrible is about to happen. “Excuse me, brother. Brother?” And I looked back, and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie. I said, “Uh-oh.” He said, “I just want to ask you a couple questions.” I said, “What publication are you with?” He said, “Me? I’m with The Daily Bongo.” I said, “Daily Bongo? What the fuck? Who the fuck reads this?” He said, “Listen, brother, I just want to ask you a quick question. You understand that this year, this is a boycott for the Oscars. So, I’m just wondering what made you, of all people, cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight.” I said, “Boycott? N i g g a, I haven’t been working in ten years. What do you mean, boycott? I’ve been on strike. Y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working. I had to watch fucking Key and Peele do my show every night! So, fuck The Daily Bongo,” is what I said. I went to the Oscars and had a wonderful time. I went in that fucking green room. It was filled with so many stars, I couldn’t even believe what I was seeing. Hollywood was seducing me all over again. I was sitting back there. I’m smoking, drinking with the stars. And then two Hollywood movie producers came over, right to me. “Oh, my God. Dave Chappelle,” said the leader one. He was obviously gay. Some guys, you can just tell. The other one seemed like a money guy. Maybe he was from Texas or some shit. But the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking. And then he hit me with: “So, David, um… do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue?” The truth is, I don’t. But if you know the game, you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas. I was like, “Yeah, man. I got plenty of ideas.” And he called my bluff. “Really? Like what?” “Huh? Oh. Um… um…” And then I just started making up shit that I thought maybe he’d like to see. I said, “I have a superhero idea.” He goes, “Really?” I go, “Yeah. He’s a– He’s a gay superhero.” He was like, “Really?! What’s it called?” “Huh? Oh, it’s called– It’s called Same Hero, New Boots. It’s about a gay sous-chef in San Francisco… that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he’s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams, supersonic gay kind of powers. And he starts saving everybody in San Francisco. But at first, he only saves gay people. Later, he saves everybody, and the whole city just falls in love with him. The only problem is, no one remembers him when he saves them.” “Well, I don’t understand. Why wouldn’t they remember him?” I said, “Because, dummy, he’s gay. He keeps changing his outfit. People come up– ‘Thanks for saving me, sir. What’s your name anyway?’ He’s like, ‘Same Hero, New Boots!’ And that motherfucker flies away.” He was like, “I like it a lot.” The Texan didn’t like that shit at all. He was upset. “That’s impossible, a gay superhero.” I said, “What? Well, I have others. I have a superhero you’d love, ’cause he’s stronger than Superman and he fights for truth, justice and the American way, like Superman, but more than Superman. He beats up Mexicans for no reason.” The Texan’s like, “You got my attention.” I’m like, “Man, this motherfucker’s so strong, he can fly and do all this great shit. Only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina. Not a long touch, just a couple of pats.” He said, “Well, what’s the problem with that?” I said, “The problem, sir, is that our hero is not a handsome man. And he’s often short on cash. So, whenever trouble breaks out, he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas. ‘Please, miss! That building’s on fire. Can I pat your vagina? Quickly. People are dying!’ But he can’t tell them exactly why. ‘Eww! Get away! You’re gross!’ ‘Please, miss! People are dying! Just a couple of pats!’ ‘Eww! Gross! Get away!’ So, he rapes them. I know, I know. That’s the dilemma for the audience. Because he rapes, but he saves a lot of lives. And he saves way more than he rapes, and he only rapes to save. But he does rape.” I didn’t realize it, but the whole green room was looking at us. All the celebrities were disgusted. “Ohh.” That guy from Texas was like, “Here’s my card. Call me on Monday.” That worked out. The second time I met OJ Simpson. It was right after the trial of the century. There I was, now a young man of probably 23. OJ Simpson was the most famous, or infamous, face on planet Earth. I was in a restaurant in Beverly Hills with my agents. I wasn’t alone in the restaurant, but I was alone. I was the only black person in the restaurant. And in the 90’s, that felt very uncomfortable. Now I tend to enjoy it at this age. I was having dinner with my agents, celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative, but I later learned fucking sucked. And suddenly, a group of women walked by. Every race was in that group. Black, white, Asian, Latina, white, white… and white again. They were all gorgeous. I watched them walk by. Then I saw a familiar face. Al Cowlings, the man from the infamous Bronco chase, walked by and embraced one of the women, and they walked towards the door. Couldn’t believe what I saw. And then, close behind him, was OJ Simpson, newly released from jail. The restaurant fell still. I was shocked. I didn’t mean to say it out loud, but it just came out. “OJ!” He stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. I was sitting in the corner of the booth. He leaned over all the white people I was having dinner with and shook my hand. “How are you, young man?” He looked in my eyes, and I could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time. And then he walked away. And I looked back at my agents, and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. And the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named Sharon who used to represent me. “How could you?” she said. “How could you shake hands with that murderer?” I said, “Sharon, with all due respect, that murderer ran for over 11,000 yards. And he was acquitted. So, you know, fuck it. The glove didn’t fit. The glove didn’t fit. Get over yourself.” Some people can’t do that. Some people just can’t get over themselves. Gay people have a hard time doing that recently. Here we go. Here comes the deep water. No, recently I’ve noticed that. I noticed it with that Manny Pacquiao controversy. Yeah, it was– Now, in the gay community’s defense, Manny Pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people, very not nice things that I won’t repeat, but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals. It wasn’t a good look. Nike took his shoes immediately. Which I thought was a little harsh. A little harsh, you know what I mean? Just ’cause he’s Asian. You know what I mean? How the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an Asian dude to appease a gay dude? You know what I mean? No? You don’t know what I mean. But Asian people kind of know what I mean. No? No Asians in the front? No? No, this is what I mean. Look, you’re an Asian dude– I say this with no disrespect. We’re all Americans, right? And we can agree that America has a huge body count all over the world, but nowhere more than Asia. Literally, if you look at history, recently, we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent. We dropped two atomic bombs on fucking Japan, and they’ve been drawing Hello Kitty and shit ever since. There’s a lot of lady-boys in the wake of our bombs. And I know these things because my wife is Asian. She’s Filipino. All right, okay. So, that explains it. Now you know why you see me at all those Filipino events. I’m not there picking up pussy. I’m dropping some off. I take my wife to all that shit. I took my wife to see Pacquiao fight Mayweather. We sat ringside, okay? That– Yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, that’s what that was. But if you know what’s popping in the Philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the Philippines growing up without their mothers. Yes. A lot of women in the Philippines go to the Arabian Peninsula, they come to the United States, they make all their money here, they send all that money back home, which is still one of the number-one staples in the Philippines’ economy– money that the expats send back to the Philippines. The men, on the other hand, are left rearing children, twiddling their thumbs, waiting on their wives’ checks. These men have been fucking emasculated. And then suddenly, a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist. This is not the guy you’re supposed to ask, “What do you think of homosexuals?” He’s not your champ. Shit. That’s why I don’t have a sneaker deal, ’cause if you say something that people don’t like, they’ll take your fucking shoes off. If Martin Luther King had a sneaker deal, we’d still be on the back of the bus. It’s true. The Nike exec would come up– “Hi, Martin. Uh… we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans. It’s upsetting our Southern distributors.” “But I don’t understand. I thought that’s why I had a sneaker deal in the first place.” “Not quite. Really, it’s a walking shoe. And we like the marching, but… Try to understand.” Fuck that shit. You know, I get it, though. I understand why gay people are mad, and I empathize. You know what? I’m just telling you this as a black dude. I support your movement. But if you want to take some advice from a Negro, pace yourself. These things take a while. Just ’cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it. Brown v. Board of Education was in. Somebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last Wednesday. It takes a minute. My wife’s friend Stewart told me that. My wife has a lot of gay friends. Stewart’s their leader. She has a lot of gay friends. And I don’t like ’em. Not ’cause they’re gay. I’m just judging them on the merits of their character. They’re just not nice dudes. They’re fucking rude houseguests. They’re sitting on my couch, giggling with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons. Then I come in, and they act like the party’s over. “Hey, Stewart. What’s going on?” This guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk. “Hi, David.” “Stewart, what’s all the beef, man? What’s going–” He always wants to have some kind of gay political argument. The last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words “husband and wife” out of the law. I said, “Why would you want those words out of the law?” He said, “Because it discriminates against same-sex couples.” I was like, “N i g g a s, please, save me the semantics. Just trust me. Take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino. You’re about to crap out! Just go outside, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, that’s the wife.” No, no. Stewart didn’t like that. Stewart educates me about this movement. I didn’t even know shit about it. He told me it’s called “LBGTQ!” I was like, “What the fuck is the ‘Q’?” Does that even make sense? “Q”? Turns out “Q” is like the vowels. That shit is sometimes “Y.” It’s for gay dudes that don’t really know they’re gay. Like prison fags who are like, “What? I’m not gay, n i g g a. I’m just sucking these dicks to pass the time. I’m not ‘G.’ I’m ‘Q.’ Ugh.” I think– Okay, again, of all those letters, the “T” has the toughest road ahead. In fact, I think the “T” should stand for “Tough road ahead.” They’ve got the longest mental gap to bridge. That’s all I’m saying. Because whenever I see one of them Ts on the street, I don’t mind them, but I’ll be like, “Man, I miss Bruce.” I’m sorry, guys. I’m 42. I remember Bruce Jenner. Before the Kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white American superhero. It was amazing. He was beating Africans at track and field. We’d never seen anything like it. He was on my cereal box growing up. You know how much of that cereal I ate? N i g g a, I didn’t know he was gonna do that. I knew before you guys knew. I heard things on the street in Hollywood. You’d just be out, see people. “Hey, what’s up, Kanye? Why the long face?” “N i g g a, you’ll see. I got two mother-in-laws now.” And when I heard he was gonna do it, I was scared. I didn’t think the public was ready. I didn’t think the media was ready. And you know what? I was wrong. Not only did the public embrace him, but the media was nice. I’d never seen anything like it. “Welcome to the world, Caitlyn. So long, Bruce. Hello, Caitlyn.” I was shocked! Is this happening? Wait a minute. Is this a time in American history where an American can make a decision for themselves, and even though other Americans don’t understand it, they’ll support it and let this person live a happy life? Is this what’s happening? If it is, then good for America. That’s Dave Chappelle, the American. Although, Dave Chappelle, the black American, he was a little jealous. I was like, “How the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination Olympics?” If the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year, there’d be a fucking war in LA. I know black dudes in Brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe. Transgenders are gangsters. I used to do business with a transgender in Hollywood. Man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom. She’d walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse. Wouldn’t say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit. Then she’d walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table. “Let’s talk business, gentlemen.” “Aaah!” Shit is scary as fuck. If your best friend pitched that to you, you’d be horrified. “Yo, n i g g a, let’s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits.” “What?! Can’t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something? You sure that’s what you want to do?” “There’s only way to find out, n i g g a. Wu-Tang! Pow! Pow! Let’s go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us. Yeah.” The third time I met OJ Simpson— The third time I met OJ Simpson, I was doing great in life. I’d just finished the second season of Chappelle’s Show. Man, those were good days. I was playing a comedy club in Miami, The Improv. I don’t know if you’ve ever been, but if you have, you’d know the door for the green room is right on the stage. Can you imagine such a thing? If I walked out of the door of the green room, bam, I was right here, right from the dressing room. And I did that. I walked out, and the whole crowd was like, “Hooray!” And I looked– ma’am, as close as you are to me– I saw him as soon as I came out: The Juice. And I saw recognition in his eyes, and it filled me with pride that he knew who I was. I didn’t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience, and I didn’t want to start a panic. But I did my show. The show went great. I said, “Good night, everyone.” They all said, “Yay!” And I didn’t say nothing to OJ, but I just gave him the signal to let him know I knew he was there. And I walked into the green room, and OJ was already in there! I was like, “How the fuck is this possible?” I was scared. And then my friends came in, and we all started talking. We sat down on the couch. And I’m just telling you what I saw with my own eyes. You can believe me or not believe me. But in my experience, OJ Simpson– one of the nicest men I’d ever met. He was nice to me. He was nice to my friends. The conversation was filled with warmth and levity, humor and wisdom. We talked for minutes, and then suddenly, the Juice said, “You know what? I’ve got to be going. But it’s good to see you again, and I’m glad things went so well.” I said, “Thanks, Juice.” And my friends said, “Yeah, goodbye, Mr. Juice.” They were new to the game. He said, “No. Thank you… for your hospitality. Good night, guys.“ And we said, “Good night.” And he just walked out of the room. And as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like, “That n i g g a did that shit. Did you feel that? I could feel like… murder in the room.” Well, you young heads missed that shit. You’re all too young. You don’t remember that. -How old are you, young, man? You. -Twenty-four. Twenty-four? You don’t know shit. You don’t know shit! You gotta Google shit that I lived through. See, this is why I lock motherfuckers’ phones up. Seriously. Because the young kids, you guys need to take a break from that– We all need to break just from that technology, just for a minute. You know, I’m from a different time, young man. A dark time to you. I’m from a time that I didn’t even used to know who was on the phone until I answered the shit. Like, when tragedy used to strike. I remember I was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom. You remember these days? And she turned it on to one of three channels. And she said, “Class, the space shuttle is taking off, and we’re all gonna watch it take off.” Man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes. That’s right. You remember. It fucking exploded! Right on television. Everybody on board, dead. Immediately presumed dead. It was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like… “You can go home.” It was a goddamn national tragedy. This was Cold War America. The Russians were laughing at us. My point is, for a guy your age wouldn’t even know the pain, because in your generation, it’s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day. How can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing? I’m getting over one cop shooting, and then another one happens, and then another one happens, and another one happens. I’m crying about Paris, and then Brussels happens. I can’t keep track of all this shit. So you just give the fuck up. That’s the hallmark of your generation, and that’s fucked up, because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history. This is the age of spin. The age where nobody knows what the fuck they’re even looking at. Did you know that Planned Parenthood was for abortions? It’s for people that don’t plan things out at all. That’s right. So, a guy your age doesn’t really know how he feels. Are you pro-choice? Are you anti-consequences? What does it all really mean? It’s easier not to care for you. But for us, we were trained to care. We were raised that way. I used to watch a fucking cartoon when I was growing up called Care Bears. It was about a fucking group of teddy-bear people. They were like teddy bears, but they were like people, and they were all different colors, and they all fucking just walked around, caring. They cared about each other and everything else. They all had different designs on their stomachs, and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside. Very, very loving group of beings. And when shit got real bad, as nice as those teddy bears were, they didn’t get mean faces. They got determined. Hmm! And the leader would say, “Come on, guys. It’s time for the Care Bear Stare!” Remember that shit? And them little teddy bears would lock arms… and stare at the problem– and I’m not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests… and would dispel anything that was fucked up. And when we grew up, we wanted to be like those bears. And then we got our hearts broken, because we found out that life wasn’t gonna let us do that and that it’s impossible to shoot love out of your chest. However, I have shot love onto somebody’s chest before. I do it all the time. It’s the next best thing. You kids don’t know. Your generation is just determined to be angry, mad. Everybody’s mad. Back when we were growing up, only black people were mad. Now everybody’s just trying to get in on the act. I try to think to myself, “When did everyone get mad?” And then I realize this happened before we were born. This is a long way to go, but… it probably started in the Second World War. Think about it. All these black men, millions of black men, leave the United States for the first time, go over to Europe with America’s Armed Forces and fight the Nazis and make more money fighting Nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the United States. And a lot of those men, while they were in Europe– just to be real, not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women. I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen. This was World War II Europe, and these were desperate times, and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things. And it’s very hard to come back to America and sit on the back of the bus after you’ve been in the South of France, getting your dick sucked for a Crunch bar or some crazy shit like that. That’s a life-changing experience. And while that was happening in Europe, here in America, for the first time, women entered the workforce en masse, by the millions. All the men were gone. Someone had to run the factory. The ladies did it. That’s right. This was the first generation of American women to have independent income en masse, and when the men came back, the women weren’t the same. American women had grown. They were uttering phrases that no woman on Earth had ever spoken before, things like, “No” and “Shut the fuck up” and “I don’t feel like it.” And then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the American public. They fucked up. They tested it for 12 years. They didn’t realize these drugs were not mind-controlling. They were mind-expanding. It was LSD and mescaline and shit like that. And for the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in. By 1960, the President of the United States was only 42 years old. Can you imagine? DMX is older than that. And he was gonna usher in a new era of peace. He was gonna avoid the Cold War. He was gonna end segregation. And they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in Dallas. This country was never the same. There were seven more major assassinations in the ’60s. Anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog. Kennedy, Kennedy, King, X, Evers, on and on. You didn’t even have to be famous. You could be a college student at Kent State, or in Mississippi, protesting the Vietnam War, and they shot them, too. The ’70s were a wild era. And while all this was going on… Bill Cosby raped 54 people. Holy shit. That’s a lot of rapes, man. This guy’s putting up real numbers. He’s like the Steph Curry of rape. Man, that’s a lot of rapes. Fifty-four? If he had raped less people… that’s still two dozen rapes! Don’t forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s over hours of rape. It only takes hours to get a pilot’s license. If rapes were aircrafts, this n i g g a is Top Gun for sure. Yeah, that’s a tough one. And I was onstage not too long ago. I was in Syracuse, New York. Yeah. Well, yeah, for Syracuse. But the show didn’t go so good… all because I was talking about Bill Cosby a little bit. Not a little bit. I’ll be honest. I talked about him for like, minutes. And a woman stood up in the back of the room, and she screamed out, “You are a fucking asshole for saying these things!” “I know.” Instantly, I felt bad. Not bad about what I was saying. I just felt bad like, “Oh, that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show.” I didn’t realize it at first, but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. By the time I saw her, I just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. I was horrified. I said, “Oh, my God! I’m gonna kick this bitch in the face.” Lucky for me, I didn’t have to. Security tackled her. But it was a really fucking horrifying scene. A scuffle ensued. And then, finally, she screamed out to me, “Women suffer!” I said, “I know.” And, ladies, I need you to know… that I know. I need you to know. Seriously, there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. I would include myself in that. Don’t ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. There’s a lot of men like that in this room. There’s a lot of men like that in the world. Or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass n i g g a s. But as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, I started to take offense. And I’ll be honest, race was involved. She was a young white woman. Well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through. “Bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?” She didn’t get it. She just kept going. “Women suffer!” “I know.” “Women suffer!” “Same team.” “Women suffer!” “I know.” And this is when she went too far: “We suffer just like you.” “Slow your roll, bitch. You suffer, yes, but not like me. Not like us.” She goes, “Suffering is suffering. What’s the difference?” I said, “Come on, white woman, you know what it is. You was in on the heist. You just don’t like your cut.” You suffer, I suffer. You suffer, I suffer. That’s how it works. Can’t do comparative suffering. If you’re hungry, and your friend says, “You know, people are starving in Africa,” “So what, n i g g a? I still want lunch.” Black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that it’s a fucking dead-end game. Blacks and Jews do that shit to each other all the time. You ever played Who Suffered More with a Jewish person? It’s a tough game. Whenever you think you’ve got the Jewish guy on the ropes, that motherfucker will be like, “Well, don’t forget about Egypt.” “Egypt?! God damn, n i g g a, I didn’t know we was going all the way back to Egypt.” What the fuck is wrong with her? What does she think? Does she think that I don’t know that rape is wrong? Does she think that maybe I don’t have empathy for Bill Cosby’s alleged victims? And I would be remiss if I didn’t remind you that technically these are all still allegations. Although, I admit it looks very bad. Perhaps if she looked at it correctly, she would have empathy for me, the man she was attacking, a 42-year-old black comedian. Obviously, Bill Cosby was a hero to me. And she doesn’t know what it feels like to think that your hero might’ve done something so heinous, my God, you can’t imagine. It’d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself… had raped 54 people. You’d say to yourself, “Oh, man, but I like chocolate ice cream. I don’t want it to rape.” Didn’t want to believe it. At first, I didn’t believe it. I said, “These people are obviously trying to destroy Dr. Cosby’s rich legacy.” Even 34 allegations into it, I was still like, “Man… he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people.” I know, I know. But it’s really tough. You guys are young. Imagine if you found out 40 years from now that Kevin Hart raped 54 people. You’d be like, “Oh, my God.” The only one that would believe that would be Katt Williams. He’d be like, “I knew that motherfucker was up to something! I knew Kevin had raped those people.” You know, I was mad at Kevin, too, though. You know why? Okay, first of all, I didn’t even know Kevin was as successful as he was. I found that shit out the hard way. I was at home when my son busted in. He said, “Dad, I need $250.” He’s only years old, so I freaked out. “What’s going on, n i g g a? Is somebody trying to kill you?” He said, “No, no. Kevin Hart’s coming to town, and I wanted to see his show.” I said, “How much are the tickets?” He said, “They’re $125.” I said, “God damn! Mine are only 80.” I said, “Why do you need $250, then?” He goes, “Because I want to go with you, Dad. Please? And there it is. So, I took him to the show. And we go, we sit right up front. The lights go down, and one opening act after another goes on. Then Kevin takes the stage. The crowd goes fucking nuts. Thousands of people. I was furious. The longer the show went on, the madder I got. Because his show was fucking outstanding. It was maddening. These people were fucking holding their stomachs. My son was slapping his knee. I’m like, “Damn, n i g g a, I do this, too.” Kevin says, “Good night.” The crowd goes crazy. And then everyone starts walking to his door, and the lights come on, and then my son is just standing there, looking at an empty stage. People are pushing past me, and nobody’s recognizing me. I’m like, “Man, this place fucking sucks!” I said, “Come on, son, let’s get out of here.” Then my son looks back at me and says, “Dad, please. Please, I have to meet him.” I was like, “Oh, my God.” So, I took him backstage. I’ve known Kevin for years, but can you believe I was scared to knock on his dressing room door? I almost said… “Son, I haven’t seen him for a long time.” And one of Kevin’s goons opened the door. “Hey, what’s up, Dave Chappelle? What are you doing, man? It’s good to see you, brother. What are you doing in this area? This is a terrible area.” I’m like, “Actually, I live around here. Listen… is Kevin here? My son just wanted to meet him real quick.” “I don’t know, ’cause Kevin’s about to eat dinner.” Just then, Kevin came around the corner to see who it was. “What? Oh, shit! What’s up, Dave? Come on back. I was just about to have dinner. I don’t know if you guys ate, but you’re welcome to join me if you’d like.” And then my son pushed passed me. It was some cold shit. He goes, “Actually, Mr. Hart, we haven’t eaten in several hours.” Man, Kevin took us into his back room. This guy had a fucking spread. It was Tuesday night. This motherfucker was having Sunday dinner. There were steaks, chops, corn with butter all over it. My son was eating all fast, embarrassing me. I was like, “Slow down, son.” He was like… Then I looked over in the corner, and there was a box of custom-made jerseys for the local team. Each one was hand-stitched, and on the back, they stitched on “K-Hart” on all of them. Kevin saw me staring at that box, and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys, and he walked right to my son. He said, “Hey, little man. I want you to have this.” And my son was like, “Thanks, Mr. Hart.” This is when I got mad. He goes, “If your father ever makes you mad, put that on.” And he walked out. Oh, that was some cold shit. Then I realized– I looked up what Kevin made on Google. I couldn’t believe that shit. Kevin is the first comedian that a Drake song could be about. Kevin could walk around his house and sing “All Me,” and the whole song would still be true. “♪ Got everything, I got everything ♪\\n♪ I cannot complain, I cannot ♪\\n♪ I don’t even know How much I really made ♪\\n♪ I forgot, it’s a lot ♪\\n♪ Fuck that, never mind what I got ♪” And his wife will be like, “Kevin, come to bed!” He’ll be like… “♪ Ho, shut the fuck up ♪ ♪ I got way too much– ♪” You know how much money you have to have to tell a girl to shut the fuck up? I have “Quiet, please” money at best. I’d have to take a loan out for “Shut the fuck up.” “Shut the fuck up–” That’s Jay Z money. And Beyoncé got “No, you shut the fuck up” money. Let’s not forget. Let’s not forget. I’ve never met Bill Cosby, so I’m not defending him. Let’s just remember that he has a valuable legacy that I can’t just throw away. I remember that he’s the first black man to ever win an Emmy in television. I also remember that he’s the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately. I remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the Super Bowl every Thursday night. And I remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of African-Americans on his show. I’m telling you, that’s no small thing. I’ve had a television show. I wouldn’t have done that shit. He gave tens of millions of dollars to African-American institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college. Not just the ones he raped. Here comes the kicker. You ready? Here’s the fact that I heard, but haven’t confirmed. I heard that when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a PA system that Bill Cosby paid for. So, you understand what I’m saying? The point is this: He rapes, but he saves. And he saves more than he rapes. But he probably does rape. Thank you very much!

I forgot. The fourth time I met OJ Simpson. The fourth time is not the funniest time, but it was the last time I’d see the Juice. For some reason, I was at the Kentucky Derby. It’s a very long story. This is right after I quit Chappelle’s Show in spectacular fashion. There was a party hosted by Michael Jordan, and every athlete I’ve ever admired was in that room. Yes. And then I saw a familiar face by the bar, standing there, drinking alone. It was Chris Tucker. Now… you have to remember, at this time, we were both technically missing. And we went over, and we’re talking with one another, and motherfuckers were amazed to see us together. Seeing me and Chris Tucker at that point would be like seeing Bigfoot riding a unicorn. You wouldn’t believe that’s what you were seeing. And then, through all the gawkers, a familiar face pushed through the crowd. Here he was again. The Juice. He had his camera ready. He was like, “Dave, Chris. Good to see you guys. Hey, come on, guys. Let’s all get together for a picture.” And at the same time, me and Chris were like, “No. I can’t do that. Sorry, Juice, my career is too flimsy to survive a picture with you.” That’s the end.

a wonderful week it’s been great here you know what it’s been ten years since the last time i played los angeles if you can imagine i know i know i’ve been gone for a very long time and unbeknownst to you it was a difficult ten years i’m not gonna take you through all the agony i’ve been through but it was tough some of it you might’ve seen i don’t know if you ever saw on tmz the big headline “dave chappelle drunk onstage in detroit” well if you saw it i wasn’t drunk i had smoked some reefer… with some rappers yeah i don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers but their weed is very strong stronger than i what i was accustomed to the article goes on to say i was booed offstage which is also incorrect i was booed i did not leave it was a long bomb it was a fucking nightmare two puffs of weed that’s all it was two puffs i never had that happen where i take two puffs of weed i looked at the guy next to me i was like “i’m gonna bomb n i g g a i can feel it” and that guy called my name “dave chappelle” n i g g a s was like… normally when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… that’s how the show started didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like “what the fuck” they started looking amongst themselves so i knew i wasn’t doing good i don’t remember what i was saying it just took one person to break the ice it was a black lady with a ford motor shirt on stood up suddenly “fuck you dave chappelle” i said “excuse me” she said “i worked all week for this shit and this show sucks” and in a weird act of racial harmony a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up “yeah” the whole crowd banded together and started chanting “we want our money back we want our money back” i said “oh shit” i snapped out of it “good people of detroit hear me hear me now you will never get your fucking money back” fuck that i said “i’m like evel knievel i get paid for the attempt i didn’t promise this shit would be good” “boo” they said “fuck you” this went on for a long time and then after the show i felt so bad i took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– i said “i’m gonna give this to charity” you know what i did i bought  worth of bubble gum and drove around detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry i was very mad at detroit that night because not only did i bomb i had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again fucking nightmare that would be like if you were having sex with a woman and for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason she had a mousetrap in her pussy you get caught in the trap and then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night i’d still do it but i’d be careful the next time the old mousetrapinthepussy trick eh fool me once yeah yeah it was a tough time and i wanted to give up sometimes i almost did give up but then right before i gave up i decided not to but i made the call they answered the phone “hello dancing with the stars” i said “not yet not yet” yeah if you see me on that shit it’s over trust me my spirit is broken if you see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my chacha fuck that i’ve been hanging out in– i haven’t been working in la but i come out here and hang out and shit i was out here a few weeks ago i almost got arrested i’m not bullshitting this happens to a lot of black people what happened was… i was coming out of one of those nightclubs in hollywood and my friend saw me i guess i was wobbling or something so he just rolled up he’s a good friend of mine he’s like “hey dave give me the keys” i was like “all right n i g g a just take the keys” and i got in the passenger’s side of my car and he drove it it was fine just talking chopping it up and then on the  the blueandwhites hit us now i should tell you the friend that was driving me was black which really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car not my fear i’m black but i’m also dave chappelle so i figured you know shit will probably be fine traffic stop started off on the right foot the cops came up to the driver’s side “hi how are you guys doing tonight” and he recognized me immediately “oh dave chappelle” and i looked at my friend like “we’re getting out of this shit” and then he says “you guys were swerving in the lane do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second” still no cause for alarm i looked through the rearview mirror the body language of the arrest looked good just talking so then i started fucking with the radio you know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car but then when i looked back in the rearview mirror something had gone horribly wrong that motherfucker was back there like… and the next thing i knew they were stuffing him in the back of the car and i thought what anybody would think in a situation like that “oh my god what is gonna happen to me” and the police walked up to the window “mr chappelle we had to arrest your friend he refused to take our breathalyzer test” i said “that motherfucker not complying that’s odd so officer what’s gonna happen to me” “you’re fine we’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home” i said “oh well no i would rather you just give me the keys” he said “mr chappelle your friend already told us he’s your designated driver we can’t let you drive in this condition” i was like “no n i g g a i’m good” and then suddenly the shit turned into vegas he was like… “i’ll let you blow for it” i said “excuse me” he said “if you blow in my breathalyzer–” i said “oh n i g g a i thought you was trying to get your dick sucked what’s the– whew whew” “if you blow in my breathalyzer and pass i’ll give you the keys to the car” i said “uh… set ’em up n i g g a let’s play” and i blew in that thing and it made a noise “beep” i said “uhoh” and he looked at it he said “oh well mr chappelle i guess you’re free to go” i said “i am” i didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed i drove home on the miles an hour yeah it all worked out it all worked out i’m one of the lucky ones it doesn’t work out that well for everybody i saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in la in traffic you see that shit on rush hour traffic they beat a black woman’s ass this woman didn’t even do anything wrong it’s fucked up it was so fucked up it didn’t even go to court the city of la just gave that woman  million for her pain and suffering that is not bad considering that’s the same amount of money that marcos maidana made to fight floyd mayweather the second time and this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life you can see it on the tape she didn’t come to fight her guards were low she was taking a lot of shots everybody’s mad at police now i watched that– you see that shit on netflix making a murderer the steven avery story if you haven’t seen it check it out steven avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the united states has ever been in in a justice system designed for him to thrive he’s failed miserably twice i can’t even wrap my mind around it if making a murderer was about a black dude that shit would be called duh of course everything would go wrong seems like he did it all right the motherfucker even had  for his legal defense that should get you off in wisconsin that’s like oj money all he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror that’s all it would’ve took because only a black dude in the united states can look at other dudes and be like “i think the police did this shit” he’s fucked up in the game that’s how oj got off i’ve been watching that new oj show i can’t get enough of that shit doesn’t it bring back good memories but i forgot just how polarizing that oj case was and you know i’ve met oj simpson on four different occasions in my life and before the end of the show i will tell you about each of those occasions the first time i met oj simpson i was in santa monica santa monica yeah i can’t believe a black dude was like “santa monica” you the last n i g g a i would expect to say that let me see your shoes you got some vans on n i g g a what you got “santa monica” you at the time i was  i had done a show and the guy from the club came up and was like “hey oj simpson’s here and he said he wants to meet you” i said “what fuck yeah” i ran down the steps and oj was down there he’s like “hey young man how are you it’s very good to meet you and you’re doing really good work and i hope good things happen for you in your life” i was like “man thanks mr juice” standing beside him was– i don’t know the nice way to say this– his soontobeslain wife ladies and gentlemen man the fuck up or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show just man the fuck up she’s dead we already know what happened we don’t know who did it but we know what happened i should tell you that woman was very nice to me she actually embraced me she said “i think you’re adorable” and she hugged me she goes “good luck to you” and she held me for a long time and i whispered in her ear “bitch are you trying to get us both killed” i’m just kidding i didn’t say that but… that was the first time in a nutshell it’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities very diverse crowd looks like you thought bernie sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker but… surprise it’s me yeah yeah you know i’m happy really to see black people come a lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to but there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows one is because obviously black people have slower internet connections i mean that would be my guess i don’t know what– actually my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community i hold so dear a couple of weeks ago i was supposed to be in flint michigan for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in flint i don’t know if you know this but the water in flint is fucking poisonous it’s actually making people sick hollywood people are like “so what at least they have water” but this water– this water is fucked up so a lot of black celebrities flew into flint and they did a tremendous charity benefit and i was on the schedule to appear uh… so the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the oscars right i know so i was on my way to the airport to go to flint and then chris rock calls me and is like “hey dave i got a ticket for you for the oscars can you make it” and i was like “sure n i g g a i’m on my way to the airport right now” come on man what am i gonna do about that water what am i a fucking superhero i need to have fun i need to live too i didn’t fuck that water up stevie wonder was there they didn’t need me i’m sorry everybody i’d never been to the oscars you’ve seen the movies i make i was excited i knew i was gonna get into some trouble because when i was walking on the red carpet the black press came after me “excuse me brother” when you hear somebody call you “brother” too much something terrible is about to happen “excuse me brother brother” and i looked back and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie i said “uhoh” he said “i just want to ask you a couple questions” i said “what publication are you with” he said “me i’m with the daily bongo” i said “daily bongo what the fuck who the fuck reads this” he said “listen brother i just want to ask you a quick question you understand that this year this is a boycott for the oscars so i’m just wondering what made you of all people cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight” i said “boycott n i g g a i haven’t been working in ten years what do you mean boycott i’ve been on strike y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working i had to watch fucking key and peele do my show every night so fuck the daily bongo” is what i said i went to the oscars and had a wonderful time i went in that fucking green room it was filled with so many stars i couldn’t even believe what i was seeing hollywood was seducing me all over again i was sitting back there i’m smoking drinking with the stars and then two hollywood movie producers came over right to me “oh my god dave chappelle” said the leader one he was obviously gay some guys you can just tell the other one seemed like a money guy maybe he was from texas or some shit but the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking and then he hit me with “so david um… do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue” the truth is i don’t but if you know the game you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas i was like “yeah man i got plenty of ideas” and he called my bluff “really like what” “huh oh um… um…” and then i just started making up shit that i thought maybe he’d like to see i said “i have a superhero idea” he goes “really” i go “yeah he’s a– he’s a gay superhero” he was like “really what’s it called” “huh oh it’s called– it’s called same hero new boots it’s about a gay souschef in san francisco… that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he’s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams supersonic gay kind of powers and he starts saving everybody in san francisco but at first he only saves gay people later he saves everybody and the whole city just falls in love with him the only problem is no one remembers him when he saves them” “well i don’t understand why wouldn’t they remember him” i said “because dummy he’s gay he keeps changing his outfit people come up– ‘thanks for saving me sir what’s your name anyway’ he’s like ‘same hero new boots’ and that motherfucker flies away” he was like “i like it a lot” the texan didn’t like that shit at all he was upset “that’s impossible a gay superhero” i said “what well i have others i have a superhero you’d love ’cause he’s stronger than superman and he fights for truth justice and the american way like superman but more than superman he beats up mexicans for no reason” the texan’s like “you got my attention” i’m like “man this motherfucker’s so strong he can fly and do all this great shit only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina not a long touch just a couple of pats” he said “well what’s the problem with that” i said “the problem sir is that our hero is not a handsome man and he’s often short on cash so whenever trouble breaks out he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas ‘please miss that building’s on fire can i pat your vagina quickly people are dying’ but he can’t tell them exactly why ‘eww get away you’re gross’ ‘please miss people are dying just a couple of pats’ ‘eww gross get away’ so he rapes them i know i know that’s the dilemma for the audience because he rapes but he saves a lot of lives and he saves way more than he rapes and he only rapes to save but he does rape” i didn’t realize it but the whole green room was looking at us all the celebrities were disgusted “ohh” that guy from texas was like “here’s my card call me on monday” that worked out the second time i met oj simpson it was right after the trial of the century there i was now a young man of probably  oj simpson was the most famous or infamous face on planet earth i was in a restaurant in beverly hills with my agents i wasn’t alone in the restaurant but i was alone i was the only black person in the restaurant and in the ’s that felt very uncomfortable now i tend to enjoy it at this age i was having dinner with my agents celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative but i later learned fucking sucked and suddenly a group of women walked by every race was in that group black white asian latina white white… and white again they were all gorgeous i watched them walk by then i saw a familiar face al cowlings the man from the infamous bronco chase walked by and embraced one of the women and they walked towards the door couldn’t believe what i saw and then close behind him was oj simpson newly released from jail the restaurant fell still i was shocked i didn’t mean to say it out loud but it just came out “oj” he stopped turned around to see who said it saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me i was sitting in the corner of the booth he leaned over all the white people i was having dinner with and shook my hand “how are you young man” he looked in my eyes and i could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time and then he walked away and i looked back at my agents and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces and the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named sharon who used to represent me “how could you” she said “how could you shake hands with that murderer” i said “sharon with all due respect that murderer ran for over  yards and he was acquitted so you know fuck it the glove didn’t fit the glove didn’t fit get over yourself” some people can’t do that some people just can’t get over themselves gay people have a hard time doing that recently here we go here comes the deep water no recently i’ve noticed that i noticed it with that manny pacquiao controversy yeah it was– now in the gay community’s defense manny pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people very not nice things that i won’t repeat but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals it wasn’t a good look nike took his shoes immediately which i thought was a little harsh a little harsh you know what i mean just ’cause he’s asian you know what i mean how the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an asian dude to appease a gay dude you know what i mean no you don’t know what i mean but asian people kind of know what i mean no no asians in the front no no this is what i mean look you’re an asian dude– i say this with no disrespect we’re all americans right and we can agree that america has a huge body count all over the world but nowhere more than asia literally if you look at history recently we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent we dropped two atomic bombs on fucking japan and they’ve been drawing hello kitty and shit ever since there’s a lot of ladyboys in the wake of our bombs and i know these things because my wife is asian she’s filipino all right okay so that explains it now you know why you see me at all those filipino events i’m not there picking up pussy i’m dropping some off i take my wife to all that shit i took my wife to see pacquiao fight mayweather we sat ringside okay that– yeah that was a quiet car ride home that’s what that was but if you know what’s popping in the philippines you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the philippines growing up without their mothers yes a lot of women in the philippines go to the arabian peninsula they come to the united states they make all their money here they send all that money back home which is still one of the numberone staples in the philippines’ economy– money that the expats send back to the philippines the men on the other hand are left rearing children twiddling their thumbs waiting on their wives’ checks these men have been fucking emasculated and then suddenly a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist this is not the guy you’re supposed to ask “what do you think of homosexuals” he’s not your champ shit that’s why i don’t have a sneaker deal ’cause if you say something that people don’t like they’ll take your fucking shoes off if martin luther king had a sneaker deal we’d still be on the back of the bus it’s true the nike exec would come up– “hi martin uh… we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans it’s upsetting our southern distributors” “but i don’t understand i thought that’s why i had a sneaker deal in the first place” “not quite really it’s a walking shoe and we like the marching but… try to understand” fuck that shit you know i get it though i understand why gay people are mad and i empathize you know what i’m just telling you this as a black dude i support your movement but if you want to take some advice from a negro pace yourself these things take a while just ’cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it brown v board of education was in somebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last wednesday it takes a minute my wife’s friend stewart told me that my wife has a lot of gay friends stewart’s their leader she has a lot of gay friends and i don’t like ’em not ’cause they’re gay i’m just judging them on the merits of their character they’re just not nice dudes they’re fucking rude houseguests they’re sitting on my couch giggling with my wife eating my motherfucking macaroons then i come in and they act like the party’s over “hey stewart what’s going on” this guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk “hi david” “stewart what’s all the beef man what’s going–” he always wants to have some kind of gay political argument the last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words “husband and wife” out of the law i said “why would you want those words out of the law” he said “because it discriminates against samesex couples” i was like “n i g g a s please save me the semantics just trust me take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino you’re about to crap out just go outside talk that over amongst yourselves and whichever one of you is gayer that’s the wife” no no stewart didn’t like that stewart educates me about this movement i didn’t even know shit about it he told me it’s called “lbgtq” i was like “what the fuck is the ‘q’” does that even make sense “q” turns out “q” is like the vowels that shit is sometimes “y” it’s for gay dudes that don’t really know they’re gay like prison fags who are like “what i’m not gay n i g g a i’m just sucking these dicks to pass the time i’m not ‘g’ i’m ‘q’ ugh” i think– okay again of all those letters the “t” has the toughest road ahead in fact i think the “t” should stand for “tough road ahead” they’ve got the longest mental gap to bridge that’s all i’m saying because whenever i see one of them ts on the street i don’t mind them but i’ll be like “man i miss bruce” i’m sorry guys i’m  i remember bruce jenner before the kardashians before all that this motherfucker was a white american superhero it was amazing he was beating africans at track and field we’d never seen anything like it he was on my cereal box growing up you know how much of that cereal i ate n i g g a i didn’t know he was gonna do that i knew before you guys knew i heard things on the street in hollywood you’d just be out see people “hey what’s up kanye why the long face” “n i g g a you’ll see i got two motherinlaws now” and when i heard he was gonna do it i was scared i didn’t think the public was ready i didn’t think the media was ready and you know what i was wrong not only did the public embrace him but the media was nice i’d never seen anything like it “welcome to the world caitlyn so long bruce hello caitlyn” i was shocked is this happening wait a minute is this a time in american history where an american can make a decision for themselves and even though other americans don’t understand it they’ll support it and let this person live a happy life is this what’s happening if it is then good for america that’s dave chappelle the american although dave chappelle the black american he was a little jealous i was like “how the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination olympics” if the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year there’d be a fucking war in la i know black dudes in brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe transgenders are gangsters i used to do business with a transgender in hollywood man everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom she’d walk in there newlyminted woman high heels purse wouldn’t say anything to us just walk around the conference table looking mean and shit then she’d walk to the head of the conference table stare at us all reach in her purse pull her old dick out and throw it on the table “let’s talk business gentlemen” “aaah” shit is scary as fuck if your best friend pitched that to you you’d be horrified “yo n i g g a let’s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits” “what can’t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something you sure that’s what you want to do” “there’s only way to find out n i g g a wutang pow pow let’s go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us yeah” the third time i met oj simpson— the third time i met oj simpson i was doing great in life i’d just finished the second season of chappelle’s show man those were good days i was playing a comedy club in miami the improv i don’t know if you’ve ever been but if you have you’d know the door for the green room is right on the stage can you imagine such a thing if i walked out of the door of the green room bam i was right here right from the dressing room and i did that i walked out and the whole crowd was like “hooray” and i looked– ma’am as close as you are to me– i saw him as soon as i came out the juice and i saw recognition in his eyes and it filled me with pride that he knew who i was i didn’t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience and i didn’t want to start a panic but i did my show the show went great i said “good night everyone” they all said “yay” and i didn’t say nothing to oj but i just gave him the signal to let him know i knew he was there and i walked into the green room and oj was already in there i was like “how the fuck is this possible” i was scared and then my friends came in and we all started talking we sat down on the couch and i’m just telling you what i saw with my own eyes you can believe me or not believe me but in my experience oj simpson– one of the nicest men i’d ever met he was nice to me he was nice to my friends the conversation was filled with warmth and levity humor and wisdom we talked for minutes and then suddenly the juice said “you know what i’ve got to be going but it’s good to see you again and i’m glad things went so well” i said “thanks juice” and my friends said “yeah goodbye mr juice” they were new to the game he said “no thank you… for your hospitality good night guys“ and we said “good night” and he just walked out of the room and as soon as the door closed we all looked at each other like “that n i g g a did that shit did you feel that i could feel like… murder in the room” well you young heads missed that shit you’re all too young you don’t remember that how old are you young man you twentyfour twentyfour you don’t know shit you don’t know shit you gotta google shit that i lived through see this is why i lock motherfuckers’ phones up seriously because the young kids you guys need to take a break from that– we all need to break just from that technology just for a minute you know i’m from a different time young man a dark time to you i’m from a time that i didn’t even used to know who was on the phone until i answered the shit like when tragedy used to strike i remember i was  years old and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom you remember these days and she turned it on to one of three channels and she said “class the space shuttle is taking off and we’re all gonna watch it take off” man that shit was going great for like three to five minutes that’s right you remember it fucking exploded right on television everybody on board dead immediately presumed dead it was so bad the teacher looked at all the kids and was like… “you can go home” it was a goddamn national tragedy this was cold war america the russians were laughing at us my point is for a guy your age wouldn’t even know the pain because in your generation it’s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day how can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing i’m getting over one cop shooting and then another one happens and then another one happens and another one happens i’m crying about paris and then brussels happens i can’t keep track of all this shit so you just give the fuck up that’s the hallmark of your generation and that’s fucked up because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history this is the age of spin the age where nobody knows what the fuck they’re even looking at did you know that planned parenthood was for abortions it’s for people that don’t plan things out at all that’s right so a guy your age doesn’t really know how he feels are you prochoice are you anticonsequences what does it all really mean it’s easier not to care for you but for us we were trained to care we were raised that way i used to watch a fucking cartoon when i was growing up called care bears it was about a fucking group of teddybear people they were like teddy bears but they were like people and they were all different colors and they all fucking just walked around caring they cared about each other and everything else they all had different designs on their stomachs and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside very very loving group of beings and when shit got real bad as nice as those teddy bears were they didn’t get mean faces they got determined hmm and the leader would say “come on guys it’s time for the care bear stare” remember that shit and them little teddy bears would lock arms… and stare at the problem– and i’m not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests… and would dispel anything that was fucked up and when we grew up we wanted to be like those bears and then we got our hearts broken because we found out that life wasn’t gonna let us do that and that it’s impossible to shoot love out of your chest however i have shot love onto somebody’s chest before i do it all the time it’s the next best thing you kids don’t know your generation is just determined to be angry mad everybody’s mad back when we were growing up only black people were mad now everybody’s just trying to get in on the act i try to think to myself “when did everyone get mad” and then i realize this happened before we were born this is a long way to go but… it probably started in the second world war think about it all these black men millions of black men leave the united states for the first time go over to europe with america’s armed forces and fight the nazis and make more money fighting nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the united states and a lot of those men while they were in europe– just to be real not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women i’m sorry ladies and gentlemen this was world war ii europe and these were desperate times and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things and it’s very hard to come back to america and sit on the back of the bus after you’ve been in the south of france getting your dick sucked for a crunch bar or some crazy shit like that that’s a lifechanging experience and while that was happening in europe here in america for the first time women entered the workforce en masse by the millions all the men were gone someone had to run the factory the ladies did it that’s right this was the first generation of american women to have independent income en masse and when the men came back the women weren’t the same american women had grown they were uttering phrases that no woman on earth had ever spoken before things like “no” and “shut the fuck up” and “i don’t feel like it” and then behind the scenes of that there was a littleknown government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the american public they fucked up they tested it for  years they didn’t realize these drugs were not mindcontrolling they were mindexpanding it was lsd and mescaline and shit like that and for the first time there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in by  the president of the united states was only  years old can you imagine dmx is older than that and he was gonna usher in a new era of peace he was gonna avoid the cold war he was gonna end segregation and they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in dallas this country was never the same there were seven more major assassinations in the ’ anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog kennedy kennedy king x evers on and on you didn’t even have to be famous you could be a college student at kent state or in mississippi protesting the vietnam war and they shot them too the ’ were a wild era and while all this was going on… bill cosby raped  people holy shit that’s a lot of rapes man this guy’s putting up real numbers he’s like the steph curry of rape man that’s a lot of rapes fiftyfour if he had raped less people… that’s still two dozen rapes don’t forget each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it ladies and gentlemen that’s over hours of rape it only takes hours to get a pilot’s license if rapes were aircrafts this n i g g a is top gun for sure yeah that’s a tough one and i was onstage not too long ago i was in syracuse new york yeah well yeah for syracuse but the show didn’t go so good… all because i was talking about bill cosby a little bit not a little bit i’ll be honest i talked about him for like minutes and a woman stood up in the back of the room and she screamed out “you are a fucking asshole for saying these things” “i know” instantly i felt bad not bad about what i was saying i just felt bad like “oh that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show” i didn’t realize it at first but not only did she say that she was rushing the stage by the time i saw her i just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode i was horrified i said “oh my god i’m gonna kick this bitch in the face” lucky for me i didn’t have to security tackled her but it was a really fucking horrifying scene a scuffle ensued and then finally she screamed out to me “women suffer” i said “i know” and ladies i need you to know… that i know i need you to know seriously there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists i would include myself in that don’t ever forget we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender there’s a lot of men like that in this room there’s a lot of men like that in the world or as we are known on the streets bitchass n i g g a s but as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me i started to take offense and i’ll be honest race was involved she was a young white woman wellintentioned but just not thinking it all the way through “bitch how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination” she didn’t get it she just kept going “women suffer” “i know” “women suffer” “same team” “women suffer” “i know” and this is when she went too far “we suffer just like you” “slow your roll bitch you suffer yes but not like me not like us” she goes “suffering is suffering what’s the difference” i said “come on white woman you know what it is you was in on the heist you just don’t like your cut” you suffer i suffer you suffer i suffer that’s how it works can’t do comparative suffering if you’re hungry and your friend says “you know people are starving in africa” “so what n i g g a i still want lunch” black people know about comparative suffering and you know that it’s a fucking deadend game blacks and jews do that shit to each other all the time you ever played who suffered more with a jewish person it’s a tough game whenever you think you’ve got the jewish guy on the ropes that motherfucker will be like “well don’t forget about egypt” “egypt god damn n i g g a i didn’t know we was going all the way back to egypt” what the fuck is wrong with her what does she think does she think that i don’t know that rape is wrong does she think that maybe i don’t have empathy for bill cosby’s alleged victims and i would be remiss if i didn’t remind you that technically these are all still allegations although i admit it looks very bad perhaps if she looked at it correctly she would have empathy for me the man she was attacking a  black comedian obviously bill cosby was a hero to me and she doesn’t know what it feels like to think that your hero might’ve done something so heinous my god you can’t imagine it’d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself… had raped  people you’d say to yourself “oh man but i like chocolate ice cream i don’t want it to rape” didn’t want to believe it at first i didn’t believe it i said “these people are obviously trying to destroy dr cosby’s rich legacy” even  allegations into it i was still like “man… he probably only raped ten or  of those people” i know i know but it’s really tough you guys are young imagine if you found out  years from now that kevin hart raped  people you’d be like “oh my god” the only one that would believe that would be katt williams he’d be like “i knew that motherfucker was up to something i knew kevin had raped those people” you know i was mad at kevin too though you know why okay first of all i didn’t even know kevin was as successful as he was i found that shit out the hard way i was at home when my son busted in he said “dad i need ” he’s only years old so i freaked out “what’s going on n i g g a is somebody trying to kill you” he said “no no kevin hart’s coming to town and i wanted to see his show” i said “how much are the tickets” he said “they’re ” i said “god damn mine are only ” i said “why do you need  then” he goes “because i want to go with you dad please and there it is so i took him to the show and we go we sit right up front the lights go down and one opening act after another goes on then kevin takes the stage the crowd goes fucking nuts thousands of people i was furious the longer the show went on the madder i got because his show was fucking outstanding it was maddening these people were fucking holding their stomachs my son was slapping his knee i’m like “damn n i g g a i do this too” kevin says “good night” the crowd goes crazy and then everyone starts walking to his door and the lights come on and then my son is just standing there looking at an empty stage people are pushing past me and nobody’s recognizing me i’m like “man this place fucking sucks” i said “come on son let’s get out of here” then my son looks back at me and says “dad please please i have to meet him” i was like “oh my god” so i took him backstage i’ve known kevin for years but can you believe i was scared to knock on his dressing room door i almost said… “son i haven’t seen him for a long time” and one of kevin’s goons opened the door “hey what’s up dave chappelle what are you doing man it’s good to see you brother what are you doing in this area this is a terrible area” i’m like “actually i live around here listen… is kevin here my son just wanted to meet him real quick” “i don’t know ’cause kevin’s about to eat dinner” just then kevin came around the corner to see who it was “what oh shit what’s up dave come on back i was just about to have dinner i don’t know if you guys ate but you’re welcome to join me if you’d like” and then my son pushed passed me it was some cold shit he goes “actually mr hart we haven’t eaten in several hours” man kevin took us into his back room this guy had a fucking spread it was tuesday night this motherfucker was having sunday dinner there were steaks chops corn with butter all over it my son was eating all fast embarrassing me i was like “slow down son” he was like… then i looked over in the corner and there was a box of custommade jerseys for the local team each one was handstitched and on the back they stitched on “khart” on all of them kevin saw me staring at that box and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys and he walked right to my son he said “hey little man i want you to have this” and my son was like “thanks mr hart” this is when i got mad he goes “if your father ever makes you mad put that on” and he walked out oh that was some cold shit then i realized– i looked up what kevin made on google i couldn’t believe that shit kevin is the first comedian that a drake song could be about kevin could walk around his house and sing “all me” and the whole song would still be true “♪ got everything i got everything ♪\\n♪ i cannot complain i cannot ♪\\n♪ i don’t even know how much i really made ♪\\n♪ i forgot it’s a lot ♪\\n♪ fuck that never mind what i got ♪” and his wife will be like “kevin come to bed” he’ll be like… “♪ ho shut the fuck up ♪ ♪ i got way too much– ♪” you know how much money you have to have to tell a girl to shut the fuck up i have “quiet please” money at best i’d have to take a loan out for “shut the fuck up” “shut the fuck up–” that’s jay z money and beyoncé got “no you shut the fuck up” money let’s not forget let’s not forget i’ve never met bill cosby so i’m not defending him let’s just remember that he has a valuable legacy that i can’t just throw away i remember that he’s the first black man to ever win an emmy in television i also remember that he’s the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately i remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the super bowl every thursday night and i remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of africanamericans on his show i’m telling you that’s no small thing i’ve had a television show i wouldn’t have done that shit he gave tens of millions of dollars to africanamerican institutions of higher learning and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college not just the ones he raped here comes the kicker you ready here’s the fact that i heard but haven’t confirmed i heard that when martin luther king stood on the steps of the lincoln memorial and said he had a dream he was speaking into a pa system that bill cosby paid for so you understand what i’m saying the point is this he rapes but he saves and he saves more than he rapes but he probably does rape thank you very much good night ♪ ahah ahah ♪\\n♪ in every

show in spectacular fashion there was a party hosted by michael jordan and every athlete i’ve ever admired was in that room yes and then i saw a familiar face by the bar standing there drinking alone it was chris tucker now… you have to remember at this time we were both technically missing and we went over and we’re talking with one another and motherfuckers were amazed to see us together seeing me and chris tucker at that point would be like seeing bigfoot riding a unicorn you wouldn’t believe that’s what you were seeing and then through all the gawkers a familiar face pushed through the crowd here he was again the juice he had his camera ready he was like “dave chris good to see you guys hey come on guys let’s all get together for a picture” and at the same time me and chris were like “no i can’t do that sorry juice my career is too flimsy to survive a picture with you” that’s the end good night ♪ ahah ahah ♪\\n♪ in every ghetto ♪\\n♪ ahah ♪\\n♪ revolution ♪\\n♪ ahah ahah ahah

wasnt it thank you guys have a seat feel comfortable relax i want to thank everyone in la for a wonderful week its been great here you know what its been ten years since the last time i played los angeles if you can imagine i know i know ive been gone for a very long time and unbeknownst to you it was a difficult ten years im not gonna take you through all the agony ive been through but it was tough some of it you mightve seen i dont know if you ever saw on tmz the big headline dave chappelle drunk onstage in detroit well if you saw it i wasnt drunk i had smoked some reefer with some rappers yeah i dont know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers but their weed is very strong stronger than i what i was accustomed to the article goes on to say i was booed offstage which is also incorrect i was booed i did not leave it was a long bomb it was a fucking nightmare two puffs of weed thats all it was two puffs i never had that happen where i take two puffs of weed i looked at the guy next to me i was like im gonna bomb n i g g a i can feel it and that guy called my name dave chappelle n i g g a s was like normally when you do a comedy show– you guys dont know what it looks like up here but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like thats how the show started didnt take long for their faces to switch up like what the fuck they started looking amongst themselves so i knew i wasnt doing good i dont remember what i was saying it just took one person to break the ice it was a black lady with a ford motor shirt on stood up suddenly fuck you dave chappelle i said excuse me she said i worked all week for this shit and this show sucks and in a weird act of racial harmony a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up yeah the whole crowd banded together and started chanting we want our money back we want our money back i said oh shit i snapped out of it good people of detroit hear me hear me now you will never get your fucking money back fuck that i said im like evel knievel i get paid for the attempt i didnt promise this shit would be good boo they said fuck you this went on for a long time and then after the show i felt so bad i took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– i said im gonna give this to charity you know what i did i bought  worth of bubble gum and drove around detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry i was very mad at detroit that night because not only did i bomb i had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again fucking nightmare that would be like if you were having sex with a woman and for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason she had a mousetrap in her pussy you get caught in the trap and then youve got to fuck her again tomorrow night id still do it but id be careful the next time the old mousetrapinthepussy trick eh fool me once yeah yeah it was a tough time and i wanted to give up sometimes i almost did give up but then right before i gave up i decided not to but i made the call they answered the phone hello dancing with the stars i said not yet not yet yeah if you see me on that shit its over trust me my spirit is broken if you see me waiting for them judges getting critiqued on my chacha fuck that ive been hanging out in– i havent been working in la but i come out here and hang out and shit i was out here a few weeks ago i almost got arrested im not bullshitting this happens to a lot of black people what happened was i was coming out of one of those nightclubs in hollywood and my friend saw me i guess i was wobbling or something so he just rolled up hes a good friend of mine hes like hey dave give me the keys i was like all right n i g g a just take the keys and i got in the passengers side of my car and he drove it it was fine just talking chopping it up and then on the  the blueandwhites hit us now i should tell you the friend that was driving me was black which really doesnt have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car not my fear im black but im also dave chappelle so i figured you know shit will probably be fine traffic stop started off on the right foot the cops came up to the drivers side hi how are you guys doing tonight and he recognized me immediately oh dave chappelle and i looked at my friend like were getting out of this shit and then he says you guys were swerving in the lane do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second still no cause for alarm i looked through the rearview mirror the body language of the arrest looked good just talking so then i started fucking with the radio you know a traffic stop is going good if youre listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car but then when i looked back in the rearview mirror something had gone horribly wrong that motherfucker was back there like and the next thing i knew they were stuffing him in the back of the car and i thought what anybody would think in a situation like that oh my god what is gonna happen to me and the police walked up to the window mr chappelle we had to arrest your friend he refused to take our breathalyzer test i said that motherfucker not complying thats odd so officer whats gonna happen to me youre fine were just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle and well arrange for you to have a ride home i said oh well no i would rather you just give me the keys he said mr chappelle your friend already told us hes your designated driver we cant let you drive in this condition i was like no n i g g a im good and then suddenly the shit turned into vegas he was like ill let you blow for it i said excuse me he said if you blow in my breathalyzer– i said oh n i g g a i thought you was trying to get your dick sucked whats the– whew whew if you blow in my breathalyzer and pass ill give you the keys to the car i said uh set em up n i g g a lets play and i blew in that thing and it made a noise beep i said uhoh and he looked at it he said oh well mr chappelle i guess youre free to go i said i am i didnt know that thing didnt pick up weed i drove home on the miles an hour yeah it all worked out it all worked out im one of the lucky ones it doesnt work out that well for everybody i saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in la in traffic you see that shit on rush hour traffic they beat a black womans ass this woman didnt even do anything wrong its fucked up it was so fucked up it didnt even go to court the city of la just gave that woman  million for her pain and suffering that is not bad considering thats the same amount of money that marcos maidana made to fight floyd mayweather the second time and this woman obviously hasnt trained a day in her life you can see it on the tape she didnt come to fight her guards were low she was taking a lot of shots everybodys mad at police now i watched that– you see that shit on netflix making a murderer the steven avery story if you havent seen it check it out steven avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the united states has ever been in in a justice system designed for him to thrive hes failed miserably twice i cant even wrap my mind around it if making a murderer was about a black dude that shit would be called duh of course everything would go wrong seems like he did it all right the motherfucker even had  for his legal defense that should get you off in wisconsin thats like oj money all he needed to get off that he didnt have was a single black juror thats all it wouldve took because only a black dude in the united states can look at other dudes and be like i think the police did this shit hes fucked up in the game thats how oj got off ive been watching that new oj show i cant get enough of that shit doesnt it bring back good memories but i forgot just how polarizing that oj case was and you know ive met oj simpson on four different occasions in my life and before the end of the show i will tell you about each of those occasions the first time i met oj simpson i was in santa monica santa monica yeah i cant believe a black dude was like santa monica you the last n i g g a i would expect to say that let me see your shoes you got some vans on n i g g a what you got santa monica you at the time i was  i had done a show and the guy from the club came up and was like hey oj simpsons here and he said he wants to meet you i said what fuck yeah i ran down the steps and oj was down there hes like hey young man how are you its very good to meet you and youre doing really good work and i hope good things happen for you in your life i was like man thanks mr juice standing beside him was– i dont know the nice way to say this– his soontobeslain wife ladies and gentlemen man the fuck up or youre not gonna make it to the end of this show just man the fuck up shes dead we already know what happened we dont know who did it but we know what happened i should tell you that woman was very nice to me she actually embraced me she said i think youre adorable and she hugged me she goes good luck to you and she held me for a long time and i whispered in her ear bitch are you trying to get us both killed im just kidding i didnt say that but that was the first time in a nutshell its good to see so many so many different people here from so many different ethnicities very diverse crowd looks like you thought bernie sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker but surprise its me yeah yeah you know im happy really to see black people come a lot of black people dont fuck with me like they used to but theres a few reasons you dont see black people at my shows one is because obviously black people have slower internet connections i mean that would be my guess i dont know what– actually my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community i hold so dear a couple of weeks ago i was supposed to be in flint michigan for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in flint i dont know if you know this but the water in flint is fucking poisonous its actually making people sick hollywood people are like so what at least they have water but this water– this water is fucked up so a lot of black celebrities flew into flint and they did a tremendous charity benefit and i was on the schedule to appear uh so the reason a lot of people havent heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the oscars right i know so i was on my way to the airport to go to flint and then chris rock calls me and is like hey dave i got a ticket for you for the oscars can you make it and i was like sure n i g g a im on my way to the airport right now come on man what am i gonna do about that water what am i a fucking superhero i need to have fun i need to live too i didnt fuck that water up stevie wonder was there they didnt need me im sorry everybody id never been to the oscars youve seen the movies i make i was excited i knew i was gonna get into some trouble because when i was walking on the red carpet the black press came after me excuse me brother when you hear somebody call you brother too much something terrible is about to happen excuse me brother brother and i looked back and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie i said uhoh he said i just want to ask you a couple questions i said what publication are you with he said me im with the daily bongo i said daily bongo what the fuck who the fuck reads this he said listen brother i just want to ask you a quick question you understand that this year this is a boycott for the oscars so im just wondering what made you of all people cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight i said boycott n i g g a i havent been working in ten years what do you mean boycott ive been on strike yall n i g g a s didnt stop working i had to watch fucking key and peele do my show every night so fuck the daily bongo is what i said i went to the oscars and had a wonderful time i went in that fucking green room it was filled with so many stars i couldnt even believe what i was seeing hollywood was seducing me all over again i was sitting back there im smoking drinking with the stars and then two hollywood movie producers came over right to me oh my god dave chappelle said the leader one he was obviously gay some guys you can just tell the other one seemed like a money guy maybe he was from texas or some shit but the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking and then he hit me with so david um do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue the truth is i dont but if you know the game youre not supposed to tell motherfuckers you dont have ideas i was like yeah man i got plenty of ideas and he called my bluff really like what huh oh um um and then i just started making up shit that i thought maybe hed like to see i said i have a superhero idea he goes really i go yeah hes a– hes a gay superhero he was like really whats it called huh oh its called– its called same hero new boots its about a gay souschef in san francisco that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when hes taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams supersonic gay kind of powers and he starts saving everybody in san francisco but at first he only saves gay people later he saves everybody and the whole city just falls in love with him the only problem is no one remembers him when he saves them well i dont understand why wouldnt they remember him i said because dummy hes gay he keeps changing his outfit people come up– thanks for saving me sir whats your name anyway hes like same hero new boots and that motherfucker flies away he was like i like it a lot the texan didnt like that shit at all he was upset thats impossible a gay superhero i said what well i have others i have a superhero youd love cause hes stronger than superman and he fights for truth justice and the american way like superman but more than superman he beats up mexicans for no reason the texans like you got my attention im like man this motherfuckers so strong he can fly and do all this great shit only problem with this guy is he cant even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a womans vagina not a long touch just a couple of pats he said well whats the problem with that i said the problem sir is that our hero is not a handsome man and hes often short on cash so whenever trouble breaks out he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas please miss that buildings on fire can i pat your vagina quickly people are dying but he cant tell them exactly why eww get away youre gross please miss people are dying just a couple of pats eww gross get away so he rapes them i know i know thats the dilemma for the audience because he rapes but he saves a lot of lives and he saves way more than he rapes and he only rapes to save but he does rape i didnt realize it but the whole green room was looking at us all the celebrities were disgusted ohh that guy from texas was like heres my card call me on monday that worked out the second time i met oj simpson it was right after the trial of the century there i was now a young man of probably  oj simpson was the most famous or infamous face on planet earth i was in a restaurant in beverly hills with my agents i wasnt alone in the restaurant but i was alone i was the only black person in the restaurant and in the s that felt very uncomfortable now i tend to enjoy it at this age i was having dinner with my agents celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative but i later learned fucking sucked and suddenly a group of women walked by every race was in that group black white asian latina white white and white again they were all gorgeous i watched them walk by then i saw a familiar face al cowlings the man from the infamous bronco chase walked by and embraced one of the women and they walked towards the door couldnt believe what i saw and then close behind him was oj simpson newly released from jail the restaurant fell still i was shocked i didnt mean to say it out loud but it just came out oj he stopped turned around to see who said it saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me i was sitting in the corner of the booth he leaned over all the white people i was having dinner with and shook my hand how are you young man he looked in my eyes and i could see in his eyes that he didnt remember meeting me the first time and then he walked away and i looked back at my agents and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces and the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named sharon who used to represent me how could you she said how could you shake hands with that murderer i said sharon with all due respect that murderer ran for over  yards and he was acquitted so you know fuck it the glove didnt fit the glove didnt fit get over yourself some people cant do that some people just cant get over themselves gay people have a hard time doing that recently here we go here comes the deep water no recently ive noticed that i noticed it with that manny pacquiao controversy yeah it was– now in the gay communitys defense manny pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people very not nice things that i wont repeat but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals it wasnt a good look nike took his shoes immediately which i thought was a little harsh a little harsh you know what i mean just cause hes asian you know what i mean how the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an asian dude to appease a gay dude you know what i mean no you dont know what i mean but asian people kind of know what i mean no no asians in the front no no this is what i mean look youre an asian dude– i say this with no disrespect were all americans right and we can agree that america has a huge body count all over the world but nowhere more than asia literally if you look at history recently we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent we dropped two atomic bombs on fucking japan and theyve been drawing hello kitty and shit ever since theres a lot of ladyboys in the wake of our bombs and i know these things because my wife is asian shes filipino all right okay so that explains it now you know why you see me at all those filipino events im not there picking up pussy im dropping some off i take my wife to all that shit i took my wife to see pacquiao fight mayweather we sat ringside okay that– yeah that was a quiet car ride home thats what that was but if you know whats popping in the philippines you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the philippines growing up without their mothers yes a lot of women in the philippines go to the arabian peninsula they come to the united states they make all their money here they send all that money back home which is still one of the numberone staples in the philippines economy– money that the expats send back to the philippines the men on the other hand are left rearing children twiddling their thumbs waiting on their wives checks these men have been fucking emasculated and then suddenly a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist this is not the guy youre supposed to ask what do you think of homosexuals hes not your champ shit thats why i dont have a sneaker deal cause if you say something that people dont like theyll take your fucking shoes off if martin luther king had a sneaker deal wed still be on the back of the bus its true the nike exec would come up– hi martin uh we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans its upsetting our southern distributors but i dont understand i thought thats why i had a sneaker deal in the first place not quite really its a walking shoe and we like the marching but try to understand fuck that shit you know i get it though i understand why gay people are mad and i empathize you know what im just telling you this as a black dude i support your movement but if you want to take some advice from a negro pace yourself these things take a while just cause they passed the law doesnt mean theyre gonna like it brown v board of education was in somebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last wednesday it takes a minute my wifes friend stewart told me that my wife has a lot of gay friends stewarts their leader she has a lot of gay friends and i dont like em not cause theyre gay im just judging them on the merits of their character theyre just not nice dudes theyre fucking rude houseguests theyre sitting on my couch giggling with my wife eating my motherfucking macaroons then i come in and they act like the partys over hey stewart whats going on this guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk hi david stewart whats all the beef man whats going– he always wants to have some kind of gay political argument the last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words husband and wife out of the law i said why would you want those words out of the law he said because it discriminates against samesex couples i was like n i g g a s please save me the semantics just trust me take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino youre about to crap out just go outside talk that over amongst yourselves and whichever one of you is gayer thats the wife no no stewart didnt like that stewart educates me about this movement i didnt even know shit about it he told me its called lbgtq i was like what the fuck is the q does that even make sense q turns out q is like the vowels that shit is sometimes y its for gay dudes that dont really know theyre gay like prison fags who are like what im not gay n i g g a im just sucking these dicks to pass the time im not g im q ugh i think– okay again of all those letters the t has the toughest road ahead in fact i think the t should stand for tough road ahead theyve got the longest mental gap to bridge thats all im saying because whenever i see one of them ts on the street i dont mind them but ill be like man i miss bruce im sorry guys im  i remember bruce jenner before the kardashians before all that this motherfucker was a white american superhero it was amazing he was beating africans at track and field wed never seen anything like it he was on my cereal box growing up you know how much of that cereal i ate n i g g a i didnt know he was gonna do that i knew before you guys knew i heard things on the street in hollywood youd just be out see people hey whats up kanye why the long face n i g g a youll see i got two motherinlaws now and when i heard he was gonna do it i was scared i didnt think the public was ready i didnt think the media was ready and you know what i was wrong not only did the public embrace him but the media was nice id never seen anything like it welcome to the world caitlyn so long bruce hello caitlyn i was shocked is this happening wait a minute is this a time in american history where an american can make a decision for themselves and even though other americans dont understand it theyll support it and let this person live a happy life is this whats happening if it is then good for america thats dave chappelle the american although dave chappelle the black american he was a little jealous i was like how the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination olympics if the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year thered be a fucking war in la i know black dudes in brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe transgenders are gangsters i used to do business with a transgender in hollywood man everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom shed walk in there newlyminted woman high heels purse wouldnt say anything to us just walk around the conference table looking mean and shit then shed walk to the head of the conference table stare at us all reach in her purse pull her old dick out and throw it on the table lets talk business gentlemen aaah shit is scary as fuck if your best friend pitched that to you youd be horrified yo n i g g a lets go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits what cant we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something you sure thats what you want to do theres only way to find out n i g g a wutang pow pow lets go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us yeah the third time i met oj simpson— the third time i met oj simpson i was doing great in life id just finished the second season of chappelles show man those were good days i was playing a comedy club in miami the improv i dont know if youve ever been but if you have youd know the door for the green room is right on the stage can you imagine such a thing if i walked out of the door of the green room bam i was right here right from the dressing room and i did that i walked out and the whole crowd was like hooray and i looked– maam as close as you are to me– i saw him as soon as i came out the juice and i saw recognition in his eyes and it filled me with pride that he knew who i was i didnt acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience and i didnt want to start a panic but i did my show the show went great i said good night everyone they all said yay and i didnt say nothing to oj but i just gave him the signal to let him know i knew he was there and i walked into the green room and oj was already in there i was like how the fuck is this possible i was scared and then my friends came in and we all started talking we sat down on the couch and im just telling you what i saw with my own eyes you can believe me or not believe me but in my experience oj simpson– one of the nicest men id ever met he was nice to me he was nice to my friends the conversation was filled with warmth and levity humor and wisdom we talked for minutes and then suddenly the juice said you know what ive got to be going but its good to see you again and im glad things went so well i said thanks juice and my friends said yeah goodbye mr juice they were new to the game he said no thank you for your hospitality good night guys and we said good night and he just walked out of the room and as soon as the door closed we all looked at each other like that n i g g a did that shit did you feel that i could feel like murder in the room well you young heads missed that shit youre all too young you dont remember that how old are you young man you twentyfour twentyfour you dont know shit you dont know shit you gotta google shit that i lived through see this is why i lock motherfuckers phones up seriously because the young kids you guys need to take a break from that– we all need to break just from that technology just for a minute you know im from a different time young man a dark time to you im from a time that i didnt even used to know who was on the phone until i answered the shit like when tragedy used to strike i remember i was  years old and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom you remember these days and she turned it on to one of three channels and she said class the space shuttle is taking off and were all gonna watch it take off man that shit was going great for like three to five minutes thats right you remember it fucking exploded right on television everybody on board dead immediately presumed dead it was so bad the teacher looked at all the kids and was like you can go home it was a goddamn national tragedy this was cold war america the russians were laughing at us my point is for a guy your age wouldnt even know the pain because in your generation its like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day how can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing im getting over one cop shooting and then another one happens and then another one happens and another one happens im crying about paris and then brussels happens i cant keep track of all this shit so you just give the fuck up thats the hallmark of your generation and thats fucked up because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history this is the age of spin the age where nobody knows what the fuck theyre even looking at did you know that planned parenthood was for abortions its for people that dont plan things out at all thats right so a guy your age doesnt really know how he feels are you prochoice are you anticonsequences what does it all really mean its easier not to care for you but for us we were trained to care we were raised that way i used to watch a fucking cartoon when i was growing up called care bears it was about a fucking group of teddybear people they were like teddy bears but they were like people and they were all different colors and they all fucking just walked around caring they cared about each other and everything else they all had different designs on their stomachs and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside very very loving group of beings and when shit got real bad as nice as those teddy bears were they didnt get mean faces they got determined hmm and the leader would say come on guys its time for the care bear stare remember that shit and them little teddy bears would lock arms and stare at the problem– and im not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests and would dispel anything that was fucked up and when we grew up we wanted to be like those bears and then we got our hearts broken because we found out that life wasnt gonna let us do that and that its impossible to shoot love out of your chest however i have shot love onto somebodys chest before i do it all the time its the next best thing you kids dont know your generation is just determined to be angry mad everybodys mad back when we were growing up only black people were mad now everybodys just trying to get in on the act i try to think to myself when did everyone get mad and then i realize this happened before we were born this is a long way to go but it probably started in the second world war think about it all these black men millions of black men leave the united states for the first time go over to europe with americas armed forces and fight the nazis and make more money fighting nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the united states and a lot of those men while they were in europe– just to be real not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women im sorry ladies and gentlemen this was world war ii europe and these were desperate times and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things and its very hard to come back to america and sit on the back of the bus after youve been in the south of france getting your dick sucked for a crunch bar or some crazy shit like that thats a lifechanging experience and while that was happening in europe here in america for the first time women entered the workforce en masse by the millions all the men were gone someone had to run the factory the ladies did it thats right this was the first generation of american women to have independent income en masse and when the men came back the women werent the same american women had grown they were uttering phrases that no woman on earth had ever spoken before things like no and shut the fuck up and i dont feel like it and then behind the scenes of that there was a littleknown government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the american public they fucked up they tested it for  years they didnt realize these drugs were not mindcontrolling they were mindexpanding it was lsd and mescaline and shit like that and for the first time there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in by  the president of the united states was only  years old can you imagine dmx is older than that and he was gonna usher in a new era of peace he was gonna avoid the cold war he was gonna end segregation and they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in dallas this country was never the same there were seven more major assassinations in the  anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog kennedy kennedy king x evers on and on you didnt even have to be famous you could be a college student at kent state or in mississippi protesting the vietnam war and they shot them too the  were a wild era and while all this was going on bill cosby raped  people holy shit thats a lot of rapes man this guys putting up real numbers hes like the steph curry of rape man thats a lot of rapes fiftyfour if he had raped less people thats still two dozen rapes dont forget each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it ladies and gentlemen thats over hours of rape it only takes hours to get a pilots license if rapes were aircrafts this n i g g a is top gun for sure yeah thats a tough one and i was onstage not too long ago i was in syracuse new york yeah well yeah for syracuse but the show didnt go so good all because i was talking about bill cosby a little bit not a little bit ill be honest i talked about him for like minutes and a woman stood up in the back of the room and she screamed out you are a fucking asshole for saying these things i know instantly i felt bad not bad about what i was saying i just felt bad like oh thats too bad she doesnt like the show i didnt realize it at first but not only did she say that she was rushing the stage by the time i saw her i just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode i was horrified i said oh my god im gonna kick this bitch in the face lucky for me i didnt have to security tackled her but it was a really fucking horrifying scene a scuffle ensued and then finally she screamed out to me women suffer i said i know and ladies i need you to know that i know i need you to know seriously theres a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists i would include myself in that dont ever forget we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender theres a lot of men like that in this room theres a lot of men like that in the world or as we are known on the streets bitchass n i g g a s but as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me i started to take offense and ill be honest race was involved she was a young white woman wellintentioned but just not thinking it all the way through bitch how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination she didnt get it she just kept going women suffer i know women suffer same team women suffer i know and this is when she went too far we suffer just like you slow your roll bitch you suffer yes but not like me not like us she goes suffering is suffering whats the difference i said come on white woman you know what it is you was in on the heist you just dont like your cut you suffer i suffer you suffer i suffer thats how it works cant do comparative suffering if youre hungry and your friend says you know people are starving in africa so what n i g g a i still want lunch black people know about comparative suffering and you know that its a fucking deadend game blacks and jews do that shit to each other all the time you ever played who suffered more with a jewish person its a tough game whenever you think youve got the jewish guy on the ropes that motherfucker will be like well dont forget about egypt egypt god damn n i g g a i didnt know we was going all the way back to egypt what the fuck is wrong with her what does she think does she think that i dont know that rape is wrong does she think that maybe i dont have empathy for bill cosbys alleged victims and i would be remiss if i didnt remind you that technically these are all still allegations although i admit it looks very bad perhaps if she looked at it correctly she would have empathy for me the man she was attacking a  black comedian obviously bill cosby was a hero to me and she doesnt know what it feels like to think that your hero mightve done something so heinous my god you cant imagine itd be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself had raped  people youd say to yourself oh man but i like chocolate ice cream i dont want it to rape didnt want to believe it at first i didnt believe it i said these people are obviously trying to destroy dr cosbys rich legacy even  allegations into it i was still like man he probably only raped ten or  of those people i know i know but its really tough you guys are young imagine if you found out  years from now that kevin hart raped  people youd be like oh my god the only one that would believe that would be katt williams hed be like i knew that motherfucker was up to something i knew kevin had raped those people you know i was mad at kevin too though you know why okay first of all i didnt even know kevin was as successful as he was i found that shit out the hard way i was at home when my son busted in he said dad i need  hes only years old so i freaked out whats going on n i g g a is somebody trying to kill you he said no no kevin harts coming to town and i wanted to see his show i said how much are the tickets he said theyre  i said god damn mine are only  i said why do you need  then he goes because i want to go with you dad please and there it is so i took him to the show and we go we sit right up front the lights go down and one opening act after another goes on then kevin takes the stage the crowd goes fucking nuts thousands of people i was furious the longer the show went on the madder i got because his show was fucking outstanding it was maddening these people were fucking holding their stomachs my son was slapping his knee im like damn n i g g a i do this too kevin says good night the crowd goes crazy and then everyone starts walking to his door and the lights come on and then my son is just standing there looking at an empty stage people are pushing past me and nobodys recognizing me im like man this place fucking sucks i said come on son lets get out of here then my son looks back at me and says dad please please i have to meet him i was like oh my god so i took him backstage ive known kevin for years but can you believe i was scared to knock on his dressing room door i almost said son i havent seen him for a long time and one of kevins goons opened the door hey whats up dave chappelle what are you doing man its good to see you brother what are you doing in this area this is a terrible area im like actually i live around here listen is kevin here my son just wanted to meet him real quick i dont know cause kevins about to eat dinner just then kevin came around the corner to see who it was what oh shit whats up dave come on back i was just about to have dinner i dont know if you guys ate but youre welcome to join me if youd like and then my son pushed passed me it was some cold shit he goes actually mr hart we havent eaten in several hours man kevin took us into his back room this guy had a fucking spread it was tuesday night this motherfucker was having sunday dinner there were steaks chops corn with butter all over it my son was eating all fast embarrassing me i was like slow down son he was like then i looked over in the corner and there was a box of custommade jerseys for the local team each one was handstitched and on the back they stitched on khart on all of them kevin saw me staring at that box and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys and he walked right to my son he said hey little man i want you to have this and my son was like thanks mr hart this is when i got mad he goes if your father ever makes you mad put that on and he walked out oh that was some cold shit then i realized– i looked up what kevin made on google i couldnt believe that shit kevin is the first comedian that a drake song could be about kevin could walk around his house and sing all me and the whole song would still be true  got everything i got everything  i cannot complain i cannot  i dont even know how much i really made  i forgot its a lot  fuck that never mind what i got  and his wife will be like kevin come to bed hell be like  ho shut the fuck up   i got way too much–  you know how much money you have to have to tell a girl to shut the fuck up i have quiet please money at best id have to take a loan out for shut the fuck up shut the fuck up– thats jay z money and beyoncé got no you shut the fuck up money lets not forget lets not forget ive never met bill cosby so im not defending him lets just remember that he has a valuable legacy that i cant just throw away i remember that hes the first black man to ever win an emmy in television i also remember that hes the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately i remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the super bowl every thursday night and i remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of africanamericans on his show im telling you thats no small thing ive had a television show i wouldnt have done that shit he gave tens of millions of dollars to africanamerican institutions of higher learning and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college not just the ones he raped here comes the kicker you ready heres the fact that i heard but havent confirmed i heard that when martin luther king stood on the steps of the lincoln memorial and said he had a dream he was speaking into a pa system that bill cosby paid for so you understand what im saying the point is this he rapes but he saves and he saves more than he rapes but he probably does rape thank you very much good night  ahah ahah  in every ghetto  ahah ahah

by michael jordan and every athlete ive ever admired was in that room yes and then i saw a familiar face by the bar standing there drinking alone it was chris tucker now you have to remember at this time we were both technically missing and we went over and were talking with one another and motherfuckers were amazed to see us together seeing me and chris tucker at that point would be like seeing bigfoot riding a unicorn you wouldnt believe thats what you were seeing and then through all the gawkers a familiar face pushed through the crowd here he was again the juice he had his camera ready he
